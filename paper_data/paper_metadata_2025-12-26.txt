Title: DramaBench: A Six-Dimensional Evaluation Framework for Drama Script Continuation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19012
Summary: Drama script continuation requires models to maintain character consistency, advance plot coherently, and preserve dramatic structurecapabilities that existing benchmarks fail to evaluate comprehensively. We present DramaBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating drama script continuation across six independent dimensions: Format Standards, Narrative Efficiency, Character Consistency, Emotional Depth, Logic Consistency, and Conflict Handling. Our framework combines rulebased analysis with LLM-based labeling and statistical metrics, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art language models on 1,103 scripts (8,824 evaluations total), with rigorous statistical significance testing (252 pairwise comparisons, 65.9% significant) and human validation (188 scripts, substantial agreement on 3/5 dimensions). Our ablation studies confirm all six dimensions capture independent quality aspects (mean | r | = 0.020). DramaBench provides actionable, dimensionspecific feedback for model improvement and establishes a rigorous standard for creative writing evaluation.

Title: From Word to World: Can Large Language Models be Implicit Text-based World Models?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18832
Summary: Agentic reinforcement learning increasingly relies on experience-driven scaling, yet real-world environments remain non-adaptive, limited in coverage, and difficult to scale. World models offer a potential way to improve learning efficiency through simulated experience, but it remains unclear whether large language models can reliably serve this role and under what conditions they meaningfully benefit agents. We study these questions in text-based environments, which provide a controlled setting to reinterpret language modeling as next-state prediction under interaction. We introduce a three-level framework for evaluating LLM-based world models: (i) fidelity and consistency, (ii) scalability and robustness, and (iii) agent utility. Across five representative environments, we find that sufficiently trained world models maintain coherent latent state, scale predictably with data and model size, and improve agent performance via action verification, synthetic trajectory generation, and warm-starting reinforcement learning. Meanwhile, these gains depend critically on behavioral coverage and environment complexity, delineating clear boundry on when world modeling effectively supports agent learning.

Title: PhononBench:A Large-Scale Phonon-Based Benchmark for Dynamical Stability in Crystal Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21227
Summary: In this work, we introduce PhononBench, the first large-scale benchmark for dynamical stability in AI-generated crystals. Leveraging the recently developed MatterSim interatomic potential, which achieves DFT-level accuracy in phonon predictions across more than 10,000 materials, PhononBench enables efficient large-scale phonon calculations and dynamical-stability analysis for 108,843 crystal structures generated by six leading crystal generation models. PhononBench reveals a widespread limitation of current generative models in ensuring dynamical stability: the average dynamical-stability rate across all generated structures is only 25.83%, with the top-performing model, MatterGen, reaching just 41.0%. Further case studies show that in property-targeted generation-illustrated here by band-gap conditioning with MatterGen--the dynamical-stability rate remains as low as 23.5% even at the optimal band-gap condition of 0.5 eV. In space-group-controlled generation, higher-symmetry crystals exhibit better stability (e.g., cubic systems achieve rates up to 49.2%), yet the average stability across all controlled generations is still only 34.4%. An important additional outcome of this study is the identification of 28,119 crystal structures that are phonon-stable across the entire Brillouin zone, providing a substantial pool of reliable candidates for future materials exploration. By establishing the first large-scale dynamical-stability benchmark, this work systematically highlights the current limitations of crystal generation models and offers essential evaluation criteria and guidance for their future development toward the design and discovery of physically viable materials. All model-generated crystal structures, phonon calculation results, and the high-throughput evaluation workflows developed in PhononBench will be openly released at https://github.com/xqh19970407/PhononBench

Title: SWE-EVO: Benchmarking Coding Agents in Long-Horizon Software Evolution Scenarios
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18470
Summary: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.

Title: Multi-hop Reasoning via Early Knowledge Alignment
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20144
Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks. The code is released at https://github.com/yxzwang/EarlyKnowledgeAlignment{Github}.

Title: DreaMontage: Arbitrary Frame-Guided One-Shot Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21252
Summary: The "one-shot" technique represents a distinct and sophisticated aesthetic in filmmaking. However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.

Title: Learning from Next-Frame Prediction: Autoregressive Video Modeling Encodes Effective Representations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21004
Summary: Recent advances in pretraining general foundation models have significantly improved performance across diverse downstream tasks. While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.

Title: TokSuite: Measuring the Impact of Tokenizer Choice on Language Model Behavior
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20757
Summary: Tokenizers provide the fundamental basis through which text is represented and processed by language models (LMs). Despite the importance of tokenization, its role in LM performance and behavior is poorly understood due to the challenge of measuring the impact of tokenization in isolation. To address this need, we present TokSuite, a collection of models and a benchmark that supports research into tokenization's influence on LMs. Specifically, we train fourteen models that use different tokenizers but are otherwise identical using the same architecture, dataset, training budget, and initialization. Additionally, we curate and release a new benchmark that specifically measures model performance subject to real-world perturbations that are likely to influence tokenization. Together, TokSuite allows robust decoupling of the influence of a model's tokenizer, supporting a series of novel findings that elucidate the respective benefits and shortcomings of a wide range of popular tokenizers.

Title: Beyond Memorization: A Multi-Modal Ordinal Regression Benchmark to Expose Popularity Bias in Vision-Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21337
Summary: We expose a significant popularity bias in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), which achieve up to 34% higher accuracy on famous buildings compared to ordinary ones, indicating a reliance on memorization over generalizable understanding. To systematically investigate this, we introduce the largest open benchmark for this task: the YearGuessr dataset, a collection of 55,546 building images with multi-modal attributes from 157 countries, annotated with continuous ordinal labels of their construction year (1001-2024), GPS data, and page-view counts as a proxy for popularity. Using this dataset, we frame the construction year prediction task as ordinal regression and introduce popularity-aware interval accuracy metrics to quantify this bias. Our resulting benchmark of 30+ models, including our YearCLIP model, confirms that VLMs excel on popular, memorized items but struggle significantly with unrecognized subjects, exposing a critical flaw in their reasoning capabilities.

Title: TurboDiffusion: Accelerating Video Diffusion Models by 100-200 Times
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16093
Summary: We introduce TurboDiffusion, a video generation acceleration framework that can speed up end-to-end diffusion generation by 100-200x while maintaining video quality. TurboDiffusion mainly relies on several components for acceleration: (1) Attention acceleration: TurboDiffusion uses low-bit SageAttention and trainable Sparse-Linear Attention (SLA) to speed up attention computation. (2) Step distillation: TurboDiffusion adopts rCM for efficient step distillation. (3) W8A8 quantization: TurboDiffusion quantizes model parameters and activations to 8 bits to accelerate linear layers and compress the model. In addition, TurboDiffusion incorporates several other engineering optimizations.   We conduct experiments on the Wan2.2-I2V-14B-720P, Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B-480P, Wan2.1-T2V-14B-720P, and Wan2.1-T2V-14B-480P models. Experimental results show that TurboDiffusion achieves 100-200x speedup for video generation even on a single RTX 5090 GPU, while maintaining comparable video quality. The GitHub repository, which includes model checkpoints and easy-to-use code, is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/TurboDiffusion.

Title: HiStream: Efficient High-Resolution Video Generation via Redundancy-Eliminated Streaming
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21338
Summary: High-resolution video generation, while crucial for digital media and film, is computationally bottlenecked by the quadratic complexity of diffusion models, making practical inference infeasible. To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.

Title: Learning to Reason in 4D: Dynamic Spatial Understanding for Vision Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20557
Summary: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

Title: T2AV-Compass: Towards Unified Evaluation for Text-to-Audio-Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21094
Summary: Text-to-Audio-Video (T2AV) generation aims to synthesize temporally coherent video and semantically synchronized audio from natural language, yet its evaluation remains fragmented, often relying on unimodal metrics or narrowly scoped benchmarks that fail to capture cross-modal alignment, instruction following, and perceptual realism under complex prompts. To address this limitation, we present T2AV-Compass, a unified benchmark for comprehensive evaluation of T2AV systems, consisting of 500 diverse and complex prompts constructed via a taxonomy-driven pipeline to ensure semantic richness and physical plausibility. Besides, T2AV-Compass introduces a dual-level evaluation framework that integrates objective signal-level metrics for video quality, audio quality, and cross-modal alignment with a subjective MLLM-as-a-Judge protocol for instruction following and realism assessment. Extensive evaluation of 11 representative T2AVsystems reveals that even the strongest models fall substantially short of human-level realism and cross-modal consistency, with persistent failures in audio realism, fine-grained synchronization, instruction following, etc. These results indicate significant improvement room for future models and highlight the value of T2AV-Compass as a challenging and diagnostic testbed for advancing text-to-audio-video generation.

Title: Streaming Video Instruction Tuning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21334
Summary: We present Streamo, a real-time streaming video LLM that serves as a general-purpose interactive assistant. Unlike existing online video models that focus narrowly on question answering or captioning, Streamo performs a broad spectrum of streaming video tasks, including real-time narration, action understanding, event captioning, temporal event grounding, and time-sensitive question answering. To develop such versatility, we construct Streamo-Instruct-465K, a large-scale instruction-following dataset tailored for streaming video understanding. The dataset covers diverse temporal contexts and multi-task supervision, enabling unified training across heterogeneous streaming tasks. After training end-to-end on the instruction-following dataset through a streamlined pipeline, Streamo exhibits strong temporal reasoning, responsive interaction, and broad generalization across a variety of streaming benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that Streamo bridges the gap between offline video perception models and real-time multimodal assistants, making a step toward unified, intelligent video understanding in continuous video streams.

PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20848
Summary: We present Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B, a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model. Nemotron 3 Nano was pretrained on 25 trillion text tokens, including more than 3 trillion new unique tokens over Nemotron 2, followed by supervised fine tuning and large-scale RL on diverse environments. Nemotron 3 Nano achieves better accuracy than our previous generation Nemotron 2 Nano while activating less than half of the parameters per forward pass. It achieves up to 3.3x higher inference throughput than similarly-sized open models like GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, while also being more accurate on popular benchmarks. Nemotron 3 Nano demonstrates enhanced agentic, reasoning, and chat abilities and supports context lengths up to 1M tokens. We release both our pretrained Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B Base and post-trained Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B checkpoints on Hugging Face.

Title: NVIDIA Nemotron 3: Efficient and Open Intelligence
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20856
Summary: We introduce the Nemotron 3 family of models - Nano, Super, and Ultra. These models deliver strong agentic, reasoning, and conversational capabilities. The Nemotron 3 family uses a Mixture-of-Experts hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to provide best-in-class throughput and context lengths of up to 1M tokens. Super and Ultra models are trained with NVFP4 and incorporate LatentMoE, a novel approach that improves model quality. The two larger models also include MTP layers for faster text generation. All Nemotron 3 models are post-trained using multi-environment reinforcement learning enabling reasoning, multi-step tool use, and support granular reasoning budget control. Nano, the smallest model, outperforms comparable models in accuracy while remaining extremely cost-efficient for inference. Super is optimized for collaborative agents and high-volume workloads such as IT ticket automation. Ultra, the largest model, provides state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning performance. Nano is released together with its technical report and this white paper, while Super and Ultra will follow in the coming months. We will openly release the model weights, pre- and post-training software, recipes, and all data for which we hold redistribution rights.

Title: LLM Swiss Round: Aggregating Multi-Benchmark Performance via Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21010
Summary: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse specialized benchmarks necessitates a shift from fragmented, task-specific metrics to a holistic, competitive ranking system that effectively aggregates performance across multiple ability dimensions. Primarily using static scoring, current evaluation methods are fundamentally limited. They struggle to determine the proper mix ratio across diverse benchmarks, and critically, they fail to capture a model's dynamic competitive fitness or its vulnerability when confronted with sequential, high-stakes tasks. To address this, we introduce the novel Competitive Swiss-System Dynamics (CSD) framework. CSD simulates a multi-round, sequential contest where models are dynamically paired across a curated sequence of benchmarks based on their accumulated win-loss record. And Monte Carlo Simulation (N=100,000 iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score (E[S_m]), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck. Furthermore, we implement a Failure Sensitivity Analysis by parameterizing the per-round elimination quantity (T_k), which allows us to profile models based on their risk appetite--distinguishing between robust generalists and aggressive specialists. We demonstrate that CSD provides a more nuanced and context-aware ranking than traditional aggregate scoring and static pairwise models, representing a vital step towards risk-informed, next-generation LLM evaluation.

Title: C2LLM Technical Report: A New Frontier in Code Retrieval via Adaptive Cross-Attention Pooling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.21332
Summary: We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate information from all tokens in the sequence, breaking the information bottleneck in EOS-based sequence embeddings, and 3) supporting flexible adaptation of embedding dimension, serving as an alternative to MRL. Trained on three million publicly available data, C2LLM models set new records on MTEB-Code among models of similar sizes, with C2LLM-7B ranking 1st on the overall leaderboard.

Title: Learning to Refocus with Video Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19823
Summary: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

Title: Memory-T1: Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Reasoning in Multi-session Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20092
Summary: Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories. The code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Elvin-Yiming-Du/Memory-T1/

Title: Scaling Laws for Code: Every Programming Language Matters
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13472
Summary: Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.

Title: Simulstream: Open-Source Toolkit for Evaluation and Demonstration of Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation Systems
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17648
Summary: Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation (StreamST) requires producing translations concurrently with incoming speech, imposing strict latency constraints and demanding models that balance partial-information decision-making with high translation quality. Research efforts on the topic have so far relied on the SimulEval repository, which is no longer maintained and does not support systems that revise their outputs. In addition, it has been designed for simulating the processing of short segments, rather than long-form audio streams, and it does not provide an easy method to showcase systems in a demo. As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems. Designed for long-form speech processing, it supports not only incremental decoding approaches, but also re-translation methods, enabling for their comparison within the same framework both in terms of quality and latency. In addition, it also offers an interactive web interface to demo any system built within the tool.

Title: Toxicity Ahead: Forecasting Conversational Derailment on GitHub
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.15031
Summary: Toxic interactions in Open Source Software (OSS) communities reduce contributor engagement and threaten project sustainability. Preventing such toxicity before it emerges requires a clear understanding of how harmful conversations unfold. However, most proactive moderation strategies are manual, requiring significant time and effort from community maintainers. To support more scalable approaches, we curate a dataset of 159 derailed toxic threads and 207 non-toxic threads from GitHub discussions. Our analysis reveals that toxicity can be forecast by tension triggers, sentiment shifts, and specific conversational patterns.   We present a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for predicting conversational derailment on GitHub using a two-step prompting pipeline. First, we generate Summaries of Conversation Dynamics (SCDs) via Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting; then we use these summaries to estimate the likelihood of derailment. Evaluated on Qwen and Llama models, our LtM strategy achieves F1-scores of 0.901 and 0.852, respectively, at a decision threshold of 0.3, outperforming established NLP baselines on conversation derailment. External validation on a dataset of 308 GitHub issue threads (65 toxic, 243 non-toxic) yields an F1-score up to 0.797. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of structured LLM prompting for early detection of conversational derailment in OSS, enabling proactive and explainable moderation.

Title: LongVideoAgent: Multi-Agent Reasoning with Long Videos
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20618
Summary: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.

Title: MemEvolve: Meta-Evolution of Agent Memory Systems
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18746
Summary: Self-evolving memory systems are unprecedentedly reshaping the evolutionary paradigm of large language model (LLM)-based agents. Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineered memory architectures to store trajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate that MemEvolve achieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such as SmolAgent and Flash-Searcher by up to 17.06%; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designing memory architectures that transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models.

Title: INTELLECT-3: Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16144
Summary: We present INTELLECT-3, a 106B-parameter Mixture-of-Experts model (12B active) trained with large-scale reinforcement learning on our end-to-end RL infrastructure stack. INTELLECT-3 achieves state of the art performance for its size across math, code, science and reasoning benchmarks, outperforming many larger frontier models. We open-source the model together with the full infrastructure stack used to create it, including RL frameworks, complete recipe, and a wide collection of environments, built with the verifiers library, for training and evaluation from our Environments Hub community platform. Built for this effort, we introduce prime-rl, an open framework for large-scale asynchronous reinforcement learning, which scales seamlessly from a single node to thousands of GPUs, and is tailored for agentic RL with first-class support for multi-turn interactions and tool use. Using this stack, we run both SFT and RL training on top of the GLM-4.5-Air-Base model, scaling RL training up to 512 H200s with high training efficiency.

Title: Multi-LLM Thematic Analysis with Dual Reliability Metrics: Combining Cohen's Kappa and Semantic Similarity for Qualitative Research Validation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20352
Summary: Qualitative research faces a critical reliability challenge: traditional inter-rater agreement methods require multiple human coders, are time-intensive, and often yield moderate consistency. We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa (κ) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format. As proof-of-concept, we evaluate three leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) on a psychedelic art therapy interview transcript, conducting six independent runs per model. Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability (κ= 0.907, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o (κ= 0.853, cosine=92.6%) and Claude (κ= 0.842, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement (κ> 0.80), validating the multi-run ensemble approach. The framework successfully extracts consensus themes across runs, with Gemini identifying 6 consensus themes (50-83% consistency), GPT-4o identifying 5 themes, and Claude 4 themes. Our open-source implementation provides researchers with transparent reliability metrics, flexible configuration, and structure-agnostic consensus extraction, establishing methodological foundations for reliable AI-assisted qualitative research.

Title: FaithLens: Detecting and Explaining Faithfulness Hallucination
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20182
Summary: Recognizing whether outputs from large language models (LLMs) contain faithfulness hallucination is crucial for real-world applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation and summarization. In this paper, we introduce FaithLens, a cost-efficient and effective faithfulness hallucination detection model that can jointly provide binary predictions and corresponding explanations to improve trustworthiness. To achieve this, we first synthesize training data with explanations via advanced LLMs and apply a well-defined data filtering strategy to ensure label correctness, explanation quality, and data diversity. Subsequently, we fine-tune the model on these well-curated training data as a cold start and further optimize it with rule-based reinforcement learning, using rewards for both prediction correctness and explanation quality. Results on 12 diverse tasks show that the 8B-parameter FaithLens outperforms advanced models such as GPT-4.1 and o3. Also, FaithLens can produce high-quality explanations, delivering a distinctive balance of trustworthiness, efficiency, and effectiveness.

Title: Active Intelligence in Video Avatars via Closed-loop World Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20615
Summary: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

Title: SemanticGen: Video Generation in Semantic Space
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20619
Summary: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Self-Improving Agent with Skill Library
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17102
Summary: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions but struggle to continuously improve and adapt when deployed in new environments. One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Title: SpatialTree: How Spatial Abilities Branch Out in MLLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20617
Summary: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

Title: QuantiPhy: A Quantitative Benchmark Evaluating Physical Reasoning Abilities of Vision-Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19526
Summary: Understanding the physical world is essential for generalist AI agents. However, it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art vision perception models (e.g., large VLMs) can reason physical properties quantitatively. Existing evaluations are predominantly VQA-based and qualitative, offering limited insight into whether these models can infer the kinematic quantities of moving objects from video observations. To address this, we present QuantiPhy, the first benchmark designed to quantitatively measure a VLM's physical reasoning ability. Comprising more than 3.3K video-text instances with numerical ground truth, QuantiPhy evaluates a VLM's performance on estimating an object's size, velocity, and acceleration at a given timestamp, using one of these properties as an input prior. The benchmark standardizes prompts and scoring to assess numerical accuracy, enabling fair comparisons across models. Our experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent gap between their qualitative plausibility and actual numerical correctness. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key factors like background noise, counterfactual priors, and strategic prompting and find that state-of-the-art VLMs lean heavily on pre-trained world knowledge rather than faithfully using the provided visual and textual inputs as references when reasoning kinematic properties quantitatively. QuantiPhy offers the first rigorous, scalable testbed to move VLMs beyond mere verbal plausibility toward a numerically grounded physical understanding.

Title: Bottom-up Policy Optimization: Your Language Model Policy Secretly Contains Internal Policies
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19673
Summary: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training. By aligning training objective at lower layer, BuPO reconstructs foundational reasoning capabilities and achieves superior performance. Extensive experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/BuPO.

Title: SAM Audio: Segment Anything in Audio
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18099
Summary: General audio source separation is a key capability for multimodal AI systems that can perceive and reason about sound. Despite substantial progress in recent years, existing separation models are either domain-specific, designed for fixed categories such as speech or music, or limited in controllability, supporting only a single prompting modality such as text. In this work, we present SAM Audio, a foundation model for general audio separation that unifies text, visual, and temporal span prompting within a single framework. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture, SAM Audio is trained with flow matching on large-scale audio data spanning speech, music, and general sounds, and can flexibly separate target sources described by language, visual masks, or temporal spans. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, including general sound, speech, music, and musical instrument separation in both in-the-wild and professionally produced audios, substantially outperforming prior general-purpose and specialized systems. Furthermore, we introduce a new real-world separation benchmark with human-labeled multimodal prompts and a reference-free evaluation model that correlates strongly with human judgment.

Title: Step-DeepResearch Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20491
Summary: As LLMs shift toward autonomous agents, Deep Research has emerged as a pivotal metric. However, existing academic benchmarks like BrowseComp often fail to meet real-world demands for open-ended research, which requires robust skills in intent recognition, long-horizon decision-making, and cross-source verification. To address this, we introduce Step-DeepResearch, a cost-effective, end-to-end agent. We propose a Data Synthesis Strategy Based on Atomic Capabilities to reinforce planning and report writing, combined with a progressive training path from agentic mid-training to SFT and RL. Enhanced by a Checklist-style Judger, this approach significantly improves robustness. Furthermore, to bridge the evaluation gap in the Chinese domain, we establish ADR-Bench for realistic deep research scenarios. Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch. These findings prove that refined training enables medium-sized models to achieve expert-level capabilities at industry-leading cost-efficiency.

Title: Is There a Better Source Distribution than Gaussian? Exploring Source Distributions for Image Flow Matching
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18184
Summary: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models. Our code is available at https://github.com/kwanseokk/SourceFM.

Title: Over++: Generative Video Compositing for Layer Interaction Effects
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19661
Summary: In professional video compositing workflows, artists must manually create environmental interactions-such as shadows, reflections, dust, and splashes-between foreground subjects and background layers. Existing video generative models struggle to preserve the input video while adding such effects, and current video inpainting methods either require costly per-frame masks or yield implausible results. We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations. Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation.

Title: SecureCode v2.0: A Production-Grade Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18542
Summary: AI assistants produce vulnerable code in 45% of security-relevant scenarios, introducing flaws into production systems at scale. Yet existing secure coding datasets fall short. They lack incident grounding, don't provide the scale modern training requires, and miss the operational security context developers need for production deployments. We present SecureCode v2.0, a production-grade dataset of 1,215 security-focused coding examples that passed structural validation and expert security review. Every example ties to actual documented security incidents with CVE references, provides vulnerable and secure implementations, demonstrates concrete attacks, and includes defense-in-depth operational guidance. The dataset covers 11 vulnerability categories (complete OWASP Top 10:2025 plus AI/ML Security Threats) across 11 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, PHP, C#, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, and YAML for infrastructure-as-code).   Our quality assurance framework ensures complete incident grounding. Each example includes SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations (Docker, AppArmor, WAF configurations), and testing approaches using language-appropriate frameworks. The dataset uses a 4-turn conversational structure mirroring actual developer-AI interactions, escalating from basic implementations to advanced security considerations and defense-in-depth guidance.   Our contributions: (1) 1,215 rigorously validated examples split into 989 training, 122 validation, and 104 test sets, (2) an automated validation framework ensuring dataset consistency, (3) a 4-turn conversational structure capturing realistic security workflows, (4) comprehensive operational security guidance with SIEM integration strategies, (5) complete language-specific implementation fidelity, and (6) open-source release of data, validation tools, and benchmarking protocols.

Title: CASA: Cross-Attention via Self-Attention for Efficient Vision-Language Fusion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19535
Summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) are commonly trained by inserting image tokens from a pretrained vision encoder into the textual stream of a language model. This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning. For samples and code, please see our project page at https://kyutai.org/casa .

Title: LoPA: Scaling dLLM Inference via Lookahead Parallel Decoding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.16229
Summary: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for high-speed inference. However, current confidence-driven decoding strategies are constrained by limited parallelism, typically achieving only 1--3 tokens per forward pass (TPF). In this work, we identify that the degree of parallelism during dLLM inference is highly sensitive to the Token Filling Order (TFO). Then, we introduce Lookahead PArallel Decoding LoPA, a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm, to identify a superior TFO and hence accelerate inference. LoPA concurrently explores distinct candidate TFOs via parallel branches, and selects the one with the highest potential for future parallelism based on branch confidence. We apply LoPA to the state-of-the-art D2F model and observe a substantial enhancement in decoding efficiency. Notably, LoPA increases the TPF of D2F-Dream to 10.1 on the GSM8K while maintaining performance superior to the Dream baseline. Furthermore, to facilitate this unprecedented degree of parallelism, we develop a specialized multi-device inference system featuring Branch Parallelism (BP), which achieves a single-sample throughput of 1073.9 tokens per second under multi-GPU deployment. The code is available at https://github.com/zhijie-group/LoPA.

Title: MatSpray: Fusing 2D Material World Knowledge on 3D Geometry
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18314
Summary: Manual modeling of material parameters and 3D geometry is a time consuming yet essential task in the gaming and film industries. While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines.

Title: Does It Tie Out? Towards Autonomous Legal Agents in Venture Capital
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18658
Summary: Before closing venture capital financing rounds, lawyers conduct diligence that includes tying out the capitalization table: verifying that every security (for example, shares, options, warrants) and issuance term (for example, vesting schedules, acceleration triggers, transfer restrictions) is supported by large sets of underlying legal documentation. While LLMs continue to improve on legal benchmarks, specialized legal workflows, such as capitalization tie-out, remain out of reach even for strong agentic systems. The task requires multi-document reasoning, strict evidence traceability, and deterministic outputs that current approaches fail to reliably deliver. We characterize capitalization tie-out as an instance of a real-world benchmark for legal AI, analyze and compare the performance of existing agentic systems, and propose a world model architecture toward tie-out automation-and more broadly as a foundation for applied legal intelligence.

Title: Understanding Syllogistic Reasoning in LLMs from Formal and Natural Language Perspectives
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12620
Summary: We study syllogistic reasoning in LLMs from the logical and natural language perspectives. In process, we explore fundamental reasoning capabilities of the LLMs and the direction this research is moving forward. To aid in our studies, we use 14 large language models and investigate their syllogistic reasoning capabilities in terms of symbolic inferences as well as natural language understanding. Even though this reasoning mechanism is not a uniform emergent property across LLMs, the perfect symbolic performances in certain models make us wonder whether LLMs are becoming more and more formal reasoning mechanisms, rather than making explicit the nuances of human reasoning.

Title: Brain-Grounded Axes for Reading and Steering LLM States
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19399
Summary: Interpretability methods for large language models (LLMs) typically derive directions from textual supervision, which can lack external grounding. We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.

Title: UCoder: Unsupervised Code Generation by Internal Probing of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17385
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

Title: Infinite-Homography as Robust Conditioning for Camera-Controlled Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17040
Summary: Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Title: LoGoPlanner: Localization Grounded Navigation Policy with Metric-aware Visual Geometry
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19629
Summary: Trajectory planning in unstructured environments is a fundamental and challenging capability for mobile robots. Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments. The code and models have been made publicly available on the https://steinate.github.io/logoplanner.github.io/{project page}.

Title: Reasoning Palette: Modulating Reasoning via Latent Contextualization for Controllable Exploration for (V)LMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17206
Summary: Exploration capacity shapes both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning (RL) training for large (vision-) language models, as stochastic sampling often yields redundant reasoning paths with little high-level diversity. This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.

Title: Real2Edit2Real: Generating Robotic Demonstrations via a 3D Control Interface
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19402
Summary: Recent progress in robot learning has been driven by large-scale datasets and powerful visuomotor policy architectures, yet policy robustness remains limited by the substantial cost of collecting diverse demonstrations, particularly for spatial generalization in manipulation tasks. To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework.
