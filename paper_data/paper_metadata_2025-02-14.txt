Title: Homeomorphism Prior for False Positive and Negative Problem in Medical Image Dense Contrastive Representation Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05282
Summary: Dense contrastive representation learning (DCRL) has greatly improved the learning efficiency for image-dense prediction tasks, showing its great potential to reduce the large costs of medical image collection and dense annotation. However, the properties of medical images make unreliable correspondence discovery, bringing an open problem of large-scale false positive and negative (FP&N) pairs in DCRL. In this paper, we propose GEoMetric vIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning which embeds the homeomorphism prior to DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense contrast. We propose a deformable homeomorphism learning (DHL) which models the homeomorphism of medical images and learns to estimate a deformable mapping to predict the pixels' correspondence under topological preservation. It effectively reduces the searching space of pairing and drives an implicit and soft learning of negative pairs via a gradient. We also propose a geometric semantic similarity (GSS) which extracts semantic information in features to measure the alignment degree for the correspondence learning. It will promote the learning efficiency and performance of deformation, constructing positive pairs reliably. We implement two practical variants on two typical representation learning tasks in our experiments. Our promising results on seven datasets which outperform the existing methods show our great superiority. We will release our code on a companion link: https://github.com/YutingHe-list/GEMINI.

Title: PDE-Controller: LLMs for Autoformalization and Reasoning of PDEs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00963
Summary: While recent AI-for-math has made strides in pure mathematics, areas of applied mathematics, particularly PDEs, remain underexplored despite their significant real-world applications. We present PDE-Controller, a framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to control systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our approach enables LLMs to transform informal natural language instructions into formal specifications, and then execute reasoning and planning steps to improve the utility of PDE control. We build a holistic solution comprising datasets (both human-written cases and 2 million synthetic samples), math-reasoning models, and novel evaluation metrics, all of which require significant effort. Our PDE-Controller significantly outperforms prompting the latest open-source and GPT models in reasoning, autoformalization, and program synthesis, achieving up to a 62% improvement in utility gain for PDE control. By bridging the gap between language generation and PDE systems, we demonstrate the potential of LLMs in addressing complex scientific and engineering challenges. We will release all data, model checkpoints, and code at https://pde-controller.github.io/.

Title: LLM Modules: Knowledge Transfer from a Large to a Small Model using Enhanced Cross-Attention
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08213
Summary: In this work, we propose an architecture of LLM Modules that enables the transfer of knowledge from a large pre-trained model to a smaller model using an Enhanced Cross-Attention mechanism. In the proposed scheme, the Qwen2-1.5B model is frozen and its representations are passed through specially designed attention layers to the GPT-Neo-125M model, which is trained on limited computational resources. Experimental results on the Bespoke-Stratos-17k dataset demonstrate that after 15 epochs of training, the combined model generates responses comparable in quality to those obtained by distillation. We discuss the advantages of the modular approach, provide examples of input queries and comparative analysis, and outline prospects for further extension of the method.

Title: Ignore the KL Penalty! Boosting Exploration on Critical Tokens to Enhance RL Fine-Tuning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06533
Summary: The ability to achieve long-term goals is a key challenge in the current development of large language models (LLMs). To address this, pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore solutions that optimize a given goal. However, exploration with LLMs is difficult, as a balance has to be struck between discovering new solutions and staying close enough to the pre-trained model, so as not to degrade basic capabilities. This is typically controlled with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty. In this paper, we investigate the exploration dynamics of a small language model on a simple arithmetic task. We show how varying degrees of pre-training influence exploration and demonstrate the importance of "critical tokens" which have a dramatic impact on the final outcome. Consequently, we introduce a simple modification to the KL penalty that favors exploration on critical tokens, increasing the efficiency of the RL fine-tuning stage.

Title: Animate Anyone 2: High-Fidelity Character Image Animation with Environment Affordance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06145
Summary: Recent character image animation methods based on diffusion models, such as Animate Anyone, have made significant progress in generating consistent and generalizable character animations. However, these approaches fail to produce reasonable associations between characters and their environments. To address this limitation, we introduce Animate Anyone 2, aiming to animate characters with environment affordance. Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the fidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract features of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature injection. We also introduce a pose modulation strategy that enables the model to handle more diverse motion patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

Title: BenchMAX: A Comprehensive Multilingual Evaluation Suite for Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07346
Summary: Previous multilingual benchmarks focus primarily on simple understanding tasks, but for large language models(LLMs), we emphasize proficiency in instruction following, reasoning, long context understanding, code generation, and so on. However, measuring these advanced capabilities across languages is underexplored. To address the disparity, we introduce BenchMAX, a multi-way multilingual evaluation benchmark that allows for fair comparisons of these important abilities across languages. To maintain high quality, three distinct native-speaking annotators independently annotate each sample within all tasks after the data was machine-translated from English into 16 other languages. Additionally, we present a novel translation challenge stemming from dataset construction. Extensive experiments on BenchMAX reveal varying effectiveness of core capabilities across languages, highlighting performance gaps that cannot be bridged by simply scaling up model size. BenchMAX serves as a comprehensive multilingual evaluation platform, providing a promising test bed to promote the development of multilingual language models. The dataset and code are publicly accessible.

Title: Mediator: Memory-efficient LLM Merging with Less Parameter Conflicts and Uncertainty Based Routing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04411
Summary: Model merging aggregates Large Language Models (LLMs) finetuned on different tasks into a stronger one. However, parameter conflicts between models leads to performance degradation in averaging. While model routing addresses this issue by selecting individual models during inference, it imposes excessive storage and compute costs, and fails to leverage the common knowledge from different models. In this work, we observe that different layers exhibit varying levels of parameter conflicts. Building on this insight, we average layers with minimal parameter conflicts and use a novel task-level expert routing for layers with significant conflicts. To further reduce storage costs, inspired by task arithmetic sparsity, we decouple multiple fine-tuned experts into a dense expert and several sparse experts. Considering the out-of-distribution samples, we select and merge appropriate experts based on the task uncertainty of the input data. We conduct extensive experiments on both LLaMA and Qwen with varying parameter scales, and evaluate on real-world reasoning tasks. Results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves significant performance improvements while requiring less system cost compared to existing methods.

Title: MetaSC: Test-Time Safety Specification Optimization for Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07985
Summary: We propose a novel dynamic safety framework that optimizes language model (LM) safety reasoning at inference time without modifying model weights. Building on recent advances in self-critique methods, our approach leverages a meta-critique mechanism that iteratively updates safety prompts-termed specifications-to drive the critique and revision process adaptively. This test-time optimization not only improves performance against adversarial jailbreak requests but also in diverse general safety-related tasks, such as avoiding moral harm or pursuing honest responses. Our empirical evaluations across several language models demonstrate that dynamically optimized safety prompts yield significantly higher safety scores compared to fixed system prompts and static self-critique defenses. Code to be released at https://github.com/vicgalle/meta-self-critique.git .

Title: WorldGUI: Dynamic Testing for Comprehensive Desktop GUI Automation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08047
Summary: Current GUI agents have achieved outstanding performance in GUI element grounding. However, planning remains highly challenging, especially due to sensitivity to the initial state of the environment. Specifically, slight differences in the initial state-such as the target software not being open or the interface not being in its default state-often lead to planning errors. This issue is widespread in real user scenarios, but existing benchmarks fail to evaluate it. In this paper, we present WorldGUI, a novel GUI benchmark that designs GUI tasks with various initial states to simulate real computer-user interactions. The benchmark spans a wide range of tasks across 10 popular software applications, including PowerPoint, VSCode, and Adobe Acrobat. In addition, to address the challenges of dynamic GUI automation tasks, we propose GUI-Thinker, a holistic framework, leveraging a critique mechanism, that effectively manages the unpredictability and complexity of GUI interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that GUI-Thinker significantly outperforms Claude-3.5 (Computer Use) by 14.9% in success rate on WorldGUI tasks. This improvement underscores the effectiveness of our critical-thinking-based framework in enhancing GUI automation.

Title: Towards Trustworthy Retrieval Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06872
Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced technique designed to address the challenges of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). By integrating context retrieval into content generation, RAG provides reliable and up-to-date external knowledge, reduces hallucinations, and ensures relevant context across a wide range of tasks. However, despite RAG's success and potential, recent studies have shown that the RAG paradigm also introduces new risks, including robustness issues, privacy concerns, adversarial attacks, and accountability issues. Addressing these risks is critical for future applications of RAG systems, as they directly impact their trustworthiness. Although various methods have been developed to improve the trustworthiness of RAG methods, there is a lack of a unified perspective and framework for research in this topic. Thus, in this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing a comprehensive roadmap for developing trustworthy RAG systems. We place our discussion around five key perspectives: reliability, privacy, safety, fairness, explainability, and accountability. For each perspective, we present a general framework and taxonomy, offering a structured approach to understanding the current challenges, evaluating existing solutions, and identifying promising future research directions. To encourage broader adoption and innovation, we also highlight the downstream applications where trustworthy RAG systems have a significant impact.

Title: NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05167
Summary: Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.

Title: TextAtlas5M: A Large-scale Dataset for Dense Text Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07870
Summary: Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.

Title: Light-A-Video: Training-free Video Relighting via Progressive Light Fusion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08590
Summary: Recent advancements in image relighting models, driven by large-scale datasets and pre-trained diffusion models, have enabled the imposition of consistent lighting. However, video relighting still lags, primarily due to the excessive training costs and the scarcity of diverse, high-quality video relighting datasets. A simple application of image relighting models on a frame-by-frame basis leads to several issues: lighting source inconsistency and relighted appearance inconsistency, resulting in flickers in the generated videos. In this work, we propose Light-A-Video, a training-free approach to achieve temporally smooth video relighting. Adapted from image relighting models, Light-A-Video introduces two key techniques to enhance lighting consistency. First, we design a Consistent Light Attention (CLA) module, which enhances cross-frame interactions within the self-attention layers to stabilize the generation of the background lighting source. Second, leveraging the physical principle of light transport independence, we apply linear blending between the source video's appearance and the relighted appearance, using a Progressive Light Fusion (PLF) strategy to ensure smooth temporal transitions in illumination. Experiments show that Light-A-Video improves the temporal consistency of relighted video while maintaining the image quality, ensuring coherent lighting transitions across frames.

Title: LASP-2: Rethinking Sequence Parallelism for Linear Attention and Its Hybrid
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07563
Summary: Linear sequence modeling approaches, such as linear attention, provide advantages like linear-time training and constant-memory inference over sequence lengths. However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are either not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or use a ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation parallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both communication and computation parallelism when training linear attention transformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work LASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear attention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of LASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed on intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence length, leading to significant improvements of both communication and computation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend LASP-2 to LASP-2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard attention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that blend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on a Linear-Llama3 model, a variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention, demonstrates the effectiveness of LASP-2 and LASP-2H. Specifically, LASP-2 achieves training speed improvements of 15.2% over LASP and 36.6% over Ring Attention, with a sequence length of 2048K across 64 GPUs. The Code is released as a part of: https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.

Title: LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08524
Summary: Next token prediction has been the standard training objective used in large language model pretraining. Representations are learned as a result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. We propose Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts continuous concepts learned from a pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the model's hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, we show that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction, knowledge distillation and inserting pause tokens. We find that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering a transparent way to guide the model's internal reasoning process.

Title: Distillation Scaling Laws
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08606
Summary: We provide a distillation scaling law that estimates distilled model performance based on a compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher. Our findings reduce the risks associated with using distillation at scale; compute allocation for both the teacher and student models can now be done to maximize student performance. We provide compute optimal distillation recipes for when 1) a teacher exists, or 2) a teacher needs training. If many students are to be distilled, or a teacher already exists, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining until a compute level which grows predictably with student size. If one student is to be distilled and a teacher also needs training, supervised learning should be done instead. Additionally, we provide insights across our large scale study of distillation, which increase our understanding of distillation and inform experimental design.

Title: SARChat-Bench-2M: A Multi-Task Vision-Language Benchmark for SAR Image Interpretation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08168
Summary: In the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing image interpretation, although Vision language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing and image understanding, their applications remain limited in professional domains due to insufficient domain expertise. This paper innovatively proposes the first large-scale multimodal dialogue dataset for SAR images, named SARChat-2M, which contains approximately 2 million high-quality image-text pairs, encompasses diverse scenarios with detailed target annotations. This dataset not only supports several key tasks such as visual understanding and object detection tasks, but also has unique innovative aspects: this study develop a visual-language dataset and benchmark for the SAR domain, enabling and evaluating VLMs' capabilities in SAR image interpretation, which provides a paradigmatic framework for constructing multimodal datasets across various remote sensing vertical domains. Through experiments on 16 mainstream VLMs, the effectiveness of the dataset has been fully verified, and the first multi-task dialogue benchmark in the SAR field has been successfully established. The project will be released at https://github.com/JimmyMa99/SARChat, aiming to promote the in-depth development and wide application of SAR visual language models.

Title: CineMaster: A 3D-Aware and Controllable Framework for Cinematic Text-to-Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08639
Summary: In this work, we present CineMaster, a novel framework for 3D-aware and controllable text-to-video generation. Our goal is to empower users with comparable controllability as professional film directors: precise placement of objects within the scene, flexible manipulation of both objects and camera in 3D space, and intuitive layout control over the rendered frames. To achieve this, CineMaster operates in two stages. In the first stage, we design an interactive workflow that allows users to intuitively construct 3D-aware conditional signals by positioning object bounding boxes and defining camera movements within the 3D space. In the second stage, these control signals--comprising rendered depth maps, camera trajectories and object class labels--serve as the guidance for a text-to-video diffusion model, ensuring to generate the user-intended video content. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of in-the-wild datasets with 3D object motion and camera pose annotations, we carefully establish an automated data annotation pipeline that extracts 3D bounding boxes and camera trajectories from large-scale video data. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that CineMaster significantly outperforms existing methods and implements prominent 3D-aware text-to-video generation.

Title: Next Block Prediction: Video Generation via Semi-Autoregressive Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07737
Summary: Next-Token Prediction (NTP) is a de facto approach for autoregressive (AR) video generation, but it suffers from suboptimal unidirectional dependencies and slow inference speed. In this work, we propose a semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) framework, called Next-Block Prediction (NBP), for video generation. By uniformly decomposing video content into equal-sized blocks (e.g., rows or frames), we shift the generation unit from individual tokens to blocks, allowing each token in the current block to simultaneously predict the corresponding token in the next block. Unlike traditional AR modeling, our framework employs bidirectional attention within each block, enabling tokens to capture more robust spatial dependencies. By predicting multiple tokens in parallel, NBP models significantly reduce the number of generation steps, leading to faster and more efficient inference. Our model achieves FVD scores of 103.3 on UCF101 and 25.5 on K600, outperforming the vanilla NTP model by an average of 4.4. Furthermore, thanks to the reduced number of inference steps, the NBP model generates 8.89 frames (128x128 resolution) per second, achieving an 11x speedup. We also explored model scales ranging from 700M to 3B parameters, observing significant improvements in generation quality, with FVD scores dropping from 103.3 to 55.3 on UCF101 and from 25.5 to 19.5 on K600, demonstrating the scalability of our approach.

Title: Fino1: On the Transferability of Reasoning Enhanced LLMs to Finance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08127
Summary: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong general reasoning abilities, yet their effectiveness in financial reasoning remains underexplored. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate 16 powerful reasoning and general LLMs on three complex financial tasks involving financial text, tabular data, and equations, assessing numerical reasoning, tabular interpretation, financial terminology comprehension, long-context processing, and equation-based problem solving. Our results show that while better datasets and pretraining improve financial reasoning, general enhancements like CoT fine-tuning do not always yield consistent gains. Moreover, all reasoning strategies face challenges in improving performance on long-context and multi-table tasks. To address these limitations, we develop a financial reasoning-enhanced model based on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, by CoT fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with domain-specific reasoning paths. Even with simple fine-tuning with one financial dataset, our model achieves a consistent 10% performance improvement across tasks, surpassing all 8B models and even Llama3-70B-Instruct and Llama3.1-70B-Instruct on average. Our results highlight the need for domain-specific adaptations in financial tasks, emphasizing future directions such as multi-table reasoning, long-context processing, and financial terminology comprehension. All our datasets, models, and codes are publicly available. Furthermore, we introduce a leaderboard for benchmarking future datasets and models.

Title: DPO-Shift: Shifting the Distribution of Direct Preference Optimization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07599
Summary: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants have become increasingly popular for aligning language models with human preferences. These methods aim to teach models to better distinguish between chosen (or preferred) and rejected (or dispreferred) responses. However, prior research has identified that the probability of chosen responses often decreases during training, and this phenomenon is known as likelihood displacement. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce \method to controllably shift the distribution of the chosen probability. Then, we show that \method exhibits a fundamental trade-off between improving the chosen probability and sacrificing the reward margin, as supported by both theoretical analysis and experimental validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of \method over DPO on downstream tasks such as MT-Bench and a designed win rate experiment. We believe this study shows that the likelihood displacement issue of DPO can be effectively mitigated with a simple, theoretically grounded solution. Our code is available at https://github.com/Meaquadddd/DPO-Shift.

Title: TransMLA: Multi-head Latent Attention Is All You Need
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07864
Summary: Modern large language models (LLMs) often encounter communication bottlenecks on current hardware, rather than purely computational constraints. Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) tackles this challenge by using low-rank matrices in the key-value (KV) layers, thereby allowing compressed latent KV states to be cached. This approach significantly reduces the KV cache size relative to traditional multi-head attention, leading to faster inference. Moreover, MLA employs an up-projection matrix to increase expressiveness, trading additional computation for reduced communication overhead. Although MLA has demonstrated efficiency and effectiveness in Deepseek V2/V3/R1, many major model providers still rely on Group Query Attention (GQA) and have not announced any plans to adopt MLA. In this paper, we show that GQA can always be represented by MLA while maintaining the same KV cache overhead, but the converse does not hold. To encourage broader use of MLA, we introduce **TransMLA**, a post-training method that converts widely used GQA-based pre-trained models (e.g., LLaMA, Qwen, Mixtral) into MLA-based models. After conversion, the model can undergo additional training to boost expressiveness without increasing the KV cache size. Furthermore, we plan to develop MLA-specific inference acceleration techniques to preserve low latency in transformed models, thus enabling more efficient distillation of Deepseek R1.

Title: Learning Conformal Abstention Policies for Adaptive Risk Management in Large Language and Vision-Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06884
Summary: Large Language and Vision-Language Models (LLMs/VLMs) are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, yet their opaque decision-making complicates risk assessment and reliability. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) helps assess prediction confidence and enables abstention when uncertainty is high. Conformal prediction (CP), a leading UQ method, provides statistical guarantees but relies on static thresholds, which fail to adapt to task complexity and evolving data distributions, leading to suboptimal trade-offs in accuracy, coverage, and informativeness. To address this, we propose learnable conformal abstention, integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with CP to optimize abstention thresholds dynamically. By treating CP thresholds as adaptive actions, our approach balances multiple objectives, minimizing prediction set size while maintaining reliable coverage. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLM/VLM benchmarks show our method outperforms Least Ambiguous Classifiers (LAC) and Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS), improving accuracy by up to 3.2%, boosting AUROC for hallucination detection by 22.19%, enhancing uncertainty-guided selective generation (AUARC) by 21.17%, and reducing calibration error by 70%-85%. These improvements hold across multiple models and datasets while consistently meeting the 90% coverage target, establishing our approach as a more effective and flexible solution for reliable decision-making in safety-critical applications. The code is available at: {https://github.com/sinatayebati/vlm-uncertainty}.

Title: Pippo: High-Resolution Multi-View Humans from a Single Image
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07785
Summary: We present Pippo, a generative model capable of producing 1K resolution dense turnaround videos of a person from a single casually clicked photo. Pippo is a multi-view diffusion transformer and does not require any additional inputs - e.g., a fitted parametric model or camera parameters of the input image. We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training. Finally, we also introduce an improved metric to evaluate 3D consistency of multi-view generations, and show that Pippo outperforms existing works on multi-view human generation from a single image.

Title: Hypencoder: Hypernetworks for Information Retrieval
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05364
Summary: The vast majority of retrieval models depend on vector inner products to produce a relevance score between a query and a document. This naturally limits the expressiveness of the relevance score that can be employed. We propose a new paradigm, instead of producing a vector to represent the query we produce a small neural network which acts as a learned relevance function. This small neural network takes in a representation of the document, in this paper we use a single vector, and produces a scalar relevance score. To produce the little neural network we use a hypernetwork, a network that produce the weights of other networks, as our query encoder or as we call it a Hypencoder. Experiments on in-domain search tasks show that Hypencoder is able to significantly outperform strong dense retrieval models and has higher metrics then reranking models and models an order of magnitude larger. Hypencoder is also shown to generalize well to out-of-domain search tasks. To assess the extent of Hypencoder's capabilities, we evaluate on a set of hard retrieval tasks including tip-of-the-tongue retrieval and instruction-following retrieval tasks and find that the performance gap widens substantially compared to standard retrieval tasks. Furthermore, to demonstrate the practicality of our method we implement an approximate search algorithm and show that our model is able to search 8.8M documents in under 60ms.

Title: Goedel-Prover: A Frontier Model for Open-Source Automated Theorem Proving
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07640
Summary: We introduce Goedel-Prover, an open-source large language model (LLM) that achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in automated formal proof generation for mathematical problems. The key challenge in this field is the scarcity of formalized math statements and proofs, which we tackle in the following ways. We train statement formalizers to translate the natural language math problems from Numina into formal language (Lean 4), creating a dataset of 1.64 million formal statements. LLMs are used to check that the formal statements accurately preserve the content of the original natural language problems. We then iteratively build a large dataset of formal proofs by training a series of provers. Each prover succeeds in proving many statements that the previous ones could not, and these new proofs are added to the training set for the next prover. The final prover outperforms all existing open-source models in whole-proof generation. On the miniF2F benchmark, it achieves a 57.6% success rate (Pass@32), exceeding the previous best open-source model by 7.6%. On PutnamBench, Goedel-Prover successfully solves 7 problems (Pass@512), ranking first on the leaderboard. Furthermore, it generates 29.7K formal proofs for Lean Workbook problems, nearly doubling the 15.7K produced by earlier works.

Title: Sparse Autoencoders for Scientifically Rigorous Interpretation of Vision Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06755
Summary: To truly understand vision models, we must not only interpret their learned features but also validate these interpretations through controlled experiments. Current approaches either provide interpretable features without the ability to test their causal influence, or enable model editing without interpretable controls. We present a unified framework using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that bridges this gap, allowing us to discover human-interpretable visual features and precisely manipulate them to test hypotheses about model behavior. By applying our method to state-of-the-art vision models, we reveal key differences in the semantic abstractions learned by models with different pre-training objectives. We then demonstrate the practical usage of our framework through controlled interventions across multiple vision tasks. We show that SAEs can reliably identify and manipulate interpretable visual features without model re-training, providing a powerful tool for understanding and controlling vision model behavior. We provide code, demos and models on our project website: https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/SAE-V.

Title: CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding

Summary: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS.

Title: Gemstones: A Model Suite for Multi-Faceted Scaling Laws
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06857
Summary: Scaling laws are typically fit using a family of models with a narrow range of frozen hyper-parameter choices. In this work we study scaling laws using a wide range of architecture and hyper-parameter choices, and highlight their impact on resulting prescriptions. As a primary artifact of our research, we release the Gemstones: the most comprehensive open-source scaling law dataset to date, consisting of over 4000 checkpoints from transformers with up to 2 billion parameters; these models have been trained with different learning rates, cooldown schedules, and architectural shapes. Our checkpoints enable more complex studies of scaling, such as a law that predicts language modeling performance as a function of model width and depth. By examining the various facets of our model suite, we find that the prescriptions of scaling laws can be highly sensitive to the experimental design process and the specific model checkpoints used during fitting.

Title: Retrieval-augmented Large Language Models for Financial Time Series Forecasting
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05878
Summary: Stock movement prediction, a fundamental task in financial time-series forecasting, requires identifying and retrieving critical influencing factors from vast amounts of time-series data. However, existing text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods fall short in handling complex financial analysis. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for financial time-series forecasting, featuring three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B parameter large language model (StockLLM) as the backbone, a novel candidate selection method leveraging LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. This enables our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while minimizing noise in complex financial data. We also construct new datasets integrating financial indicators and historical stock prices to train FinSeer and ensure robust evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms bare StockLLM and random retrieval, highlighting its effectiveness, while FinSeer surpasses existing retrieval methods, achieving an 8\% higher accuracy on BIGDATA22 and retrieving more impactful sequences. This work underscores the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel framework for future research.

Title: Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction: Pay Less Attention to Learn More
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07490
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are discovered to suffer from accurately retrieving key information. To address this, we propose Mask-Enhanced Autoregressive Prediction (MEAP), a simple yet effective training paradigm that seamlessly integrates Masked Language Modeling (MLM) into Next-Token Prediction (NTP) to enhance the latter's in-context retrieval capabilities. Specifically, MEAP first randomly masks a small fraction of input tokens and then directly performs the standard next-token prediction autoregressive using a decoder-only Transformer. MEAP eliminates the need for bidirectional attention or encoder-decoder architectures for MLM, incurring no additional computational overhead during pre-training or inference. Intensive experiments demonstrate that MEAP substantially outperforms NTP on key information retrieval and long-context reasoning tasks, while performing on par or better on commonsense reasoning tasks. The benefits of MEAP also extend to supervised fine-tuning, where it shows remarkable advantages in lost-in-the-middle scenarios, outperforming NTP by 11.77 percentage points. Our analysis indicates that MEAP's effectiveness arises from its ability to promote more distinguishable attention scores by concentrating on a reduced set of non-masked tokens. This mechanism improves the model's focus on task-relevant signals while mitigating the influence of peripheral context. These findings position MEAP as a promising training paradigm for large language models.

Title: Skill Expansion and Composition in Parameter Space
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05932
Summary: Humans excel at reusing prior knowledge to address new challenges and developing skills while solving problems. This paradigm becomes increasingly popular in the development of autonomous agents, as it develops systems that can self-evolve in response to new challenges like human beings. However, previous methods suffer from limited training efficiency when expanding new skills and fail to fully leverage prior knowledge to facilitate new task learning. In this paper, we propose Parametric Skill Expansion and Composition (PSEC), a new framework designed to iteratively evolve the agents' capabilities and efficiently address new challenges by maintaining a manageable skill library. This library can progressively integrate skill primitives as plug-and-play Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules in parameter-efficient finetuning, facilitating efficient and flexible skill expansion. This structure also enables the direct skill compositions in parameter space by merging LoRA modules that encode different skills, leveraging shared information across skills to effectively program new skills. Based on this, we propose a context-aware module to dynamically activate different skills to collaboratively handle new tasks. Empowering diverse applications including multi-objective composition, dynamics shift, and continual policy shift, the results on D4RL, DSRL benchmarks, and the DeepMind Control Suite show that PSEC exhibits superior capacity to leverage prior knowledge to efficiently tackle new challenges, as well as expand its skill libraries to evolve the capabilities.

Title: Éclair -- Extracting Content and Layout with Integrated Reading Order for Documents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04223
Summary: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is widely used to extract text from images of documents, facilitating efficient digitization and data retrieval. However, merely extracting text is insufficient when dealing with complex documents. Fully comprehending such documents requires an understanding of their structure -- including formatting, formulas, tables, and the reading order of multiple blocks and columns across multiple pages -- as well as semantic information for detecting elements like footnotes and image captions. This comprehensive understanding is crucial for downstream tasks such as retrieval, document question answering, and data curation for training Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this, we introduce \'Eclair, a general-purpose text-extraction tool specifically designed to process a wide range of document types. Given an image, \'Eclair is able to extract formatted text in reading order, along with bounding boxes and their corresponding semantic classes. To thoroughly evaluate these novel capabilities, we introduce our diverse human-annotated benchmark for document-level OCR and semantic classification. \'Eclair achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on this benchmark, outperforming other methods across key metrics. Additionally, we evaluate \'Eclair on established benchmarks, demonstrating its versatility and strength across several evaluation standards.

Title: Expect the Unexpected: FailSafe Long Context QA for Finance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06329
Summary: We propose a new long-context financial benchmark, FailSafeQA, designed to test the robustness and context-awareness of LLMs against six variations in human-interface interactions in LLM-based query-answer systems within finance. We concentrate on two case studies: Query Failure and Context Failure. In the Query Failure scenario, we perturb the original query to vary in domain expertise, completeness, and linguistic accuracy. In the Context Failure case, we simulate the uploads of degraded, irrelevant, and empty documents. We employ the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and use fine-grained rating criteria to define and calculate Robustness, Context Grounding, and Compliance scores for 24 off-the-shelf models. The results suggest that although some models excel at mitigating input perturbations, they must balance robust answering with the ability to refrain from hallucinating. Notably, Palmyra-Fin-128k-Instruct, recognized as the most compliant model, maintained strong baseline performance but encountered challenges in sustaining robust predictions in 17% of test cases. On the other hand, the most robust model, OpenAI o3-mini, fabricated information in 41% of tested cases. The results demonstrate that even high-performing models have significant room for improvement and highlight the role of FailSafeQA as a tool for developing LLMs optimized for dependability in financial applications.

Title: FocalCodec: Low-Bitrate Speech Coding via Focal Modulation Networks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04465
Summary: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling. Demo samples, code and checkpoints are available at https://lucadellalib.github.io/focalcodec-web/.

Title: Teaching Language Models to Critique via Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03492
Summary: Teaching large language models (LLMs) to critique and refine their outputs is crucial for building systems that can iteratively improve, yet it is fundamentally limited by the ability to provide accurate judgments and actionable suggestions. In this work, we study LLM critics for code generation and propose CTRL, a framework for Critic Training via Reinforcement Learning, which trains a critic model to generate feedback that maximizes correction performance for a fixed generator model without human supervision. Our results demonstrate that critics trained with CTRL significantly enhance pass rates and mitigate compounding errors across both base and stronger generator models. Furthermore, we show that these critic models act as accurate generative reward models and enable test-time scaling through iterative critique-revision, achieving up to 106.1% relative improvements across challenging code generation benchmarks.

Title: Magic 1-For-1: Generating One Minute Video Clips within One Minute
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07701
Summary: In this technical report, we present Magic 1-For-1 (Magic141), an efficient video generation model with optimized memory consumption and inference latency. The key idea is simple: factorize the text-to-video generation task into two separate easier tasks for diffusion step distillation, namely text-to-image generation and image-to-video generation. We verify that with the same optimization algorithm, the image-to-video task is indeed easier to converge over the text-to-video task. We also explore a bag of optimization tricks to reduce the computational cost of training the image-to-video (I2V) models from three aspects: 1) model convergence speedup by using a multi-modal prior condition injection; 2) inference latency speed up by applying an adversarial step distillation, and 3) inference memory cost optimization with parameter sparsification. With those techniques, we are able to generate 5-second video clips within 3 seconds. By applying a test time sliding window, we are able to generate a minute-long video within one minute with significantly improved visual quality and motion dynamics, spending less than 1 second for generating 1 second video clips on average. We conduct a series of preliminary explorations to find out the optimal tradeoff between computational cost and video quality during diffusion step distillation and hope this could be a good foundation model for open-source explorations. The code and the model weights are available at https://github.com/DA-Group-PKU/Magic-1-For-1.

Title: Forget What You Know about LLMs Evaluations - LLMs are Like a Chameleon
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07445
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) often appear to excel on public benchmarks, but these high scores may mask an overreliance on dataset-specific surface cues rather than true language understanding. We introduce the Chameleon Benchmark Overfit Detector (C-BOD), a meta-evaluation framework that systematically distorts benchmark prompts via a parametric transformation and detects overfitting of LLMs. By rephrasing inputs while preserving their semantic content and labels, C-BOD exposes whether a model's performance is driven by memorized patterns. Evaluated on the MMLU benchmark using 26 leading LLMs, our method reveals an average performance degradation of 2.15% under modest perturbations, with 20 out of 26 models exhibiting statistically significant differences. Notably, models with higher baseline accuracy exhibit larger performance differences under perturbation, and larger LLMs tend to be more sensitive to rephrasings indicating that both cases may overrely on fixed prompt patterns. In contrast, the Llama family and models with lower baseline accuracy show insignificant degradation, suggesting reduced dependency on superficial cues. Moreover, C-BOD's dataset- and model-agnostic design allows easy integration into training pipelines to promote more robust language understanding. Our findings challenge the community to look beyond leaderboard scores and prioritize resilience and generalization in LLM evaluation.

Title: VidCRAFT3: Camera, Object, and Lighting Control for Image-to-Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07531
Summary: Recent image-to-video generation methods have demonstrated success in enabling control over one or two visual elements, such as camera trajectory or object motion. However, these methods are unable to offer control over multiple visual elements due to limitations in data and network efficacy. In this paper, we introduce VidCRAFT3, a novel framework for precise image-to-video generation that enables control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction simultaneously. To better decouple control over each visual element, we propose the Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer, which integrates lighting direction, text, and image in a symmetric way. Since most real-world video datasets lack lighting annotations, we construct a high-quality synthetic video dataset, the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset. This dataset includes lighting direction annotations and objects of diverse appearance, enabling VidCRAFT3 to effectively handle strong light transmission and reflection effects. Additionally, we propose a three-stage training strategy that eliminates the need for training data annotated with multiple visual elements (camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction) simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of VidCRAFT3 in producing high-quality video content, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of control granularity and visual coherence. All code and data will be publicly available. Project page: https://sixiaozheng.github.io/VidCRAFT3/.

Title: CAD-Editor: A Locate-then-Infill Framework with Automated Training Data Synthesis for Text-Based CAD Editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03997
Summary: Computer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries. Text-based CAD editing, which automates the modification of CAD models based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored. Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce CAD-Editor, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Title: Enhance-A-Video: Better Generated Video for Free
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07508
Summary: DiT-based video generation has achieved remarkable results, but research into enhancing existing models remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a training-free approach to enhance the coherence and quality of DiT-based generated videos, named Enhance-A-Video. The core idea is enhancing the cross-frame correlations based on non-diagonal temporal attention distributions. Thanks to its simple design, our approach can be easily applied to most DiT-based video generation frameworks without any retraining or fine-tuning. Across various DiT-based video generation models, our approach demonstrates promising improvements in both temporal consistency and visual quality. We hope this research can inspire future explorations in video generation enhancement.

Title: Auditing Prompt Caching in Language Model APIs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07776
Summary: Prompt caching in large language models (LLMs) results in data-dependent timing variations: cached prompts are processed faster than non-cached prompts. These timing differences introduce the risk of side-channel timing attacks. For example, if the cache is shared across users, an attacker could identify cached prompts from fast API response times to learn information about other users' prompts. Because prompt caching may cause privacy leakage, transparency around the caching policies of API providers is important. To this end, we develop and conduct statistical audits to detect prompt caching in real-world LLM API providers. We detect global cache sharing across users in seven API providers, including OpenAI, resulting in potential privacy leakage about users' prompts. Timing variations due to prompt caching can also result in leakage of information about model architecture. Namely, we find evidence that OpenAI's embedding model is a decoder-only Transformer, which was previously not publicly known.

Title: NatureLM: Deciphering the Language of Nature for Scientific Discovery
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07527
Summary: Foundation models have revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models, researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains, including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, these models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the "language of nature", we introduce Nature Language Model (briefly, NatureLM), a sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery. Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i) generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like SMILES-to-IUPAC translation and retrosynthesis on USPTO-50k. NatureLM offers a promising generalist approach for various scientific tasks, including drug discovery (hit generation/optimization, ADMET optimization, synthesis), novel material design, and the development of therapeutic proteins or nucleotides. We have developed NatureLM models in different sizes (1 billion, 8 billion, and 46.7 billion parameters) and observed a clear improvement in performance as the model size increases.

Title: Hephaestus: Improving Fundamental Agent Capabilities of Large Language Models through Continual Pre-Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06589
Summary: Due to the scarcity of agent-oriented pre-training data, LLM-based autonomous agents typically rely on complex prompting or extensive fine-tuning, which often fails to introduce new capabilities while preserving strong generalizability. We introduce Hephaestus-Forge, the first large-scale pre-training corpus designed to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLM agents in API function calling, intrinsic reasoning and planning, and adapting to environmental feedback. Hephaestus-Forge comprises 103B agent-specific data encompassing 76,537 APIs, including both tool documentation to introduce knowledge of API functions and function calling trajectories to strengthen intrinsic reasoning. To explore effective training protocols, we investigate scaling laws to identify the optimal recipe in data mixing ratios. By continual pre-training on Hephaestus-Forge, Hephaestus outperforms small- to medium-scale open-source LLMs and rivals commercial LLMs on three agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pre-training corpus in enhancing fundamental agentic capabilities and generalization of LLMs to new tasks or environments.

Title: Scaling Pre-training to One Hundred Billion Data for Vision Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07617
Summary: We provide an empirical investigation of the potential of pre-training vision-language models on an unprecedented scale: 100 billion examples. We find that model performance tends to saturate at this scale on many common Western-centric classification and retrieval benchmarks, such as COCO Captions. Nevertheless, tasks of cultural diversity achieve more substantial gains from the 100-billion scale web data, thanks to its coverage of long-tail concepts. Furthermore, we analyze the model's multilinguality and show gains in low-resource languages as well. In addition, we observe that reducing the size of the pretraining dataset via quality filters like using CLIP, typically used to enhance performance, may inadvertently reduce the cultural diversity represented even in large-scale datasets. Our results highlight that while traditional benchmarks may not benefit significantly from scaling noisy, raw web data to 100 billion examples, this data scale is vital for building truly inclusive multimodal systems.

Title: CodeI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07316
Summary: Reasoning is a fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, we propose CodeI/O, a novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to universal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++ and achieving higher performance. Our data and models are available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/CodeIO.

Title: LLMs Can Easily Learn to Reason from Demonstrations Structure, not content, is what matters!
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07374
Summary: Large reasoning models (LRMs) tackle complex reasoning problems by following long chain-of-thoughts (Long CoT) that incorporate reflection, backtracking, and self-validation. However, the training techniques and data requirements to elicit Long CoT remain poorly understood. In this work, we find that a Large Language model (LLM) can effectively learn Long CoT reasoning through data-efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA). With just 17k long CoT training samples, the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model achieves significant improvements on a wide range of math and coding benchmarks, including 56.7% (+40.0%) on AIME 2024 and 57.0% (+8.1%) on LiveCodeBench, competitive to the proprietary o1-preview model's score of 44.6% and 59.1%. More importantly, we find that the structure of Long CoT is critical to the learning process, whereas the content of individual reasoning steps has minimal impact. Perturbations affecting content, such as training on incorrect samples or removing reasoning keywords, have little impact on performance. In contrast, structural modifications that disrupt logical consistency in the Long CoT, such as shuffling or deleting reasoning steps, significantly degrade accuracy. For example, a model trained on Long CoT samples with incorrect answers still achieves only 3.2% lower accuracy compared to training with fully correct samples. These insights deepen our understanding of how to elicit reasoning capabilities in LLMs and highlight key considerations for efficiently training the next generation of reasoning models. This is the academic paper of our previous released Sky-T1-32B-Preview model. Codes are available at https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyThought.

Title: Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06807
Summary: We show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.

Title: Forbidden Science: Dual-Use AI Challenge Benchmark and Scientific Refusal Tests
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06867
Summary: The development of robust safety benchmarks for large language models requires open, reproducible datasets that can measure both appropriate refusal of harmful content and potential over-restriction of legitimate scientific discourse. We present an open-source dataset and testing framework for evaluating LLM safety mechanisms across mainly controlled substance queries, analyzing four major models' responses to systematically varied prompts. Our results reveal distinct safety profiles: Claude-3.5-sonnet demonstrated the most conservative approach with 73% refusals and 27% allowances, while Mistral attempted to answer 100% of queries. GPT-3.5-turbo showed moderate restriction with 10% refusals and 90% allowances, and Grok-2 registered 20% refusals and 80% allowances. Testing prompt variation strategies revealed decreasing response consistency, from 85% with single prompts to 65% with five variations. This publicly available benchmark enables systematic evaluation of the critical balance between necessary safety restrictions and potential over-censorship of legitimate scientific inquiry, while providing a foundation for measuring progress in AI safety implementation. Chain-of-thought analysis reveals potential vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms, highlighting the complexity of implementing robust safeguards without unduly restricting desirable and valid scientific discourse.

Title: Jakiro: Boosting Speculative Decoding with Decoupled Multi-Head via MoE
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06282
Summary: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by using a smaller draft model to predict multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by the larger target model. However, the limited capacity of the draft model often necessitates tree-based sampling to improve prediction accuracy, where multiple candidates are generated at each step. We identify a key limitation in this approach: the candidates at the same step are derived from the same representation, limiting diversity and reducing overall effectiveness. To address this, we propose Jakiro, leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE), where independent experts generate diverse predictions, effectively decoupling correlations among candidates. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid inference strategy, combining autoregressive decoding for initial tokens with parallel decoding for subsequent stages, and enhance the latter with contrastive mechanism in features to improve accuracy. Our method significantly boosts prediction accuracy and achieves higher inference speedups. Extensive experiments across diverse models validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, establishing a new SOTA in speculative decoding. Our codes are available at https://github.com/haiduo/Jakiro.
