Title: VLMGuard: Defending VLMs against Malicious Prompts via Unlabeled Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00296
Summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for contextual understanding of both visual and textual information. However, their vulnerability to adversarially manipulated inputs presents significant risks, leading to compromised outputs and raising concerns about the reliability in VLM-integrated applications. Detecting these malicious prompts is thus crucial for maintaining trust in VLM generations. A major challenge in developing a safeguarding prompt classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled benign and malicious data. To address the issue, we introduce VLMGuard, a novel learning framework that leverages the unlabeled user prompts in the wild for malicious prompt detection. These unlabeled prompts, which naturally arise when VLMs are deployed in the open world, consist of both benign and malicious information. To harness the unlabeled data, we present an automated maliciousness estimation score for distinguishing between benign and malicious samples within this unlabeled mixture, thereby enabling the training of a binary prompt classifier on top. Notably, our framework does not require extra human annotations, offering strong flexibility and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiment shows VLMGuard achieves superior detection results, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Title: PHI-S: Distribution Balancing for Label-Free Multi-Teacher Distillation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01680
Summary: Various visual foundation models have distinct strengths and weaknesses, both of which can be improved through heterogeneous multi-teacher knowledge distillation without labels, termed "agglomerative models." We build upon this body of work by studying the effect of the teachers' activation statistics, particularly the impact of the loss function on the resulting student model quality. We explore a standard toolkit of statistical normalization techniques to better align the different distributions and assess their effects. Further, we examine the impact on downstream teacher-matching metrics, which motivates the use of Hadamard matrices. With these matrices, we demonstrate useful properties, showing how they can be used for isotropic standardization, where each dimension of a multivariate distribution is standardized using the same scale. We call this technique "PHI Standardization" (PHI-S) and empirically demonstrate that it produces the best student model across the suite of methods studied.

Title: EmoKnob: Enhance Voice Cloning with Fine-Grained Emotion Control
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00316
Summary: While recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology produce natural and expressive speech, they lack the option for users to select emotion and control intensity. We propose EmoKnob, a framework that allows fine-grained emotion control in speech synthesis with few-shot demonstrative samples of arbitrary emotion. Our framework leverages the expressive speaker representation space made possible by recent advances in foundation voice cloning models. Based on the few-shot capability of our emotion control framework, we propose two methods to apply emotion control on emotions described by open-ended text, enabling an intuitive interface for controlling a diverse array of nuanced emotions. To facilitate a more systematic emotional speech synthesis field, we introduce a set of evaluation metrics designed to rigorously assess the faithfulness and recognizability of emotion control frameworks. Through objective and subjective evaluations, we show that our emotion control framework effectively embeds emotions into speech and surpasses emotion expressiveness of commercial TTS services.

Title: BordIRlines: A Dataset for Evaluating Cross-lingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01171
Summary: Large language models excel at creative generation but continue to struggle with the issues of hallucination and bias. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a framework for grounding LLMs' responses in accurate and up-to-date information, it still raises the question of bias: which sources should be selected for inclusion in the context? And how should their importance be weighted? In this paper, we study the challenge of cross-lingual RAG and present a dataset to investigate the robustness of existing systems at answering queries about geopolitical disputes, which exist at the intersection of linguistic, cultural, and political boundaries. Our dataset is sourced from Wikipedia pages containing information relevant to the given queries and we investigate the impact of including additional context, as well as the composition of this context in terms of language and source, on an LLM's response. Our results show that existing RAG systems continue to be challenged by cross-lingual use cases and suffer from a lack of consistency when they are provided with competing information in multiple languages. We present case studies to illustrate these issues and outline steps for future research to address these challenges. We make our dataset and code publicly available at https://github.com/manestay/bordIRlines.

Title: SonicSim: A customizable simulation platform for speech processing in moving sound source scenarios
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01481
Summary: The systematic evaluation of speech separation and enhancement models under moving sound source conditions typically requires extensive data comprising diverse scenarios. However, real-world datasets often contain insufficient data to meet the training and evaluation requirements of models. Although synthetic datasets offer a larger volume of data, their acoustic simulations lack realism. Consequently, neither real-world nor synthetic datasets effectively fulfill practical needs. To address these issues, we introduce SonicSim, a synthetic toolkit de-designed to generate highly customizable data for moving sound sources. SonicSim is developed based on the embodied AI simulation platform, Habitat-sim, supporting multi-level adjustments, including scene-level, microphone-level, and source-level, thereby generating more diverse synthetic data. Leveraging SonicSim, we constructed a moving sound source benchmark dataset, SonicSet, using the Librispeech, the Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50K) and Free Music Archive (FMA), and 90 scenes from the Matterport3D to evaluate speech separation and enhancement models. Additionally, to validate the differences between synthetic data and real-world data, we randomly selected 5 hours of raw data without reverberation from the SonicSet validation set to record a real-world speech separation dataset, which was then compared with the corresponding synthetic datasets. Similarly, we utilized the real-world speech enhancement dataset RealMAN to validate the acoustic gap between other synthetic datasets and the SonicSet dataset for speech enhancement. The results indicate that the synthetic data generated by SonicSim can effectively generalize to real-world scenarios. Demo and code are publicly available at https://cslikai.cn/SonicSim/.

Title: Old Optimizer, New Norm: An Anthology
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20325
Summary: Deep learning optimizers are often motivated through a mix of convex and approximate second-order theory. We select three such methods -- Adam, Shampoo and Prodigy -- and argue that each method can instead be understood as a squarely first-order method without convexity assumptions. In fact, after switching off exponential moving averages, each method is equivalent to steepest descent under a particular norm. By generalizing this observation, we chart a new design space for training algorithms. Different operator norms should be assigned to different tensors based on the role that the tensor plays within the network. For example, while linear and embedding layers may have the same weight space of R^{mtimes n}, these layers play different roles and should be assigned different norms. We hope that this idea of carefully metrizing the neural architecture might lead to more stable, scalable and indeed faster training.

Title: FactAlign: Long-form Factuality Alignment of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01691
Summary: Large language models have demonstrated significant potential as the next-generation information access engines. However, their reliability is hindered by issues of hallucination and generating non-factual content. This is particularly problematic in long-form responses, where assessing and ensuring factual accuracy is complex. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing FactAlign, a novel alignment framework designed to enhance the factuality of LLMs' long-form responses while maintaining their helpfulness. We introduce fKTO, a fine-grained, sentence-level alignment algorithm that extends the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) alignment method. Leveraging recent advances in automatic factuality evaluation, FactAlign utilizes fine-grained factuality assessments to guide the alignment process. Our experiments on open-domain prompts and information-seeking questions demonstrate that FactAlign significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLM responses while also improving their helpfulness. Further analyses identify that FactAlign is capable of training LLMs to provide more information without losing factual precision, thus improving the factual F1 score. Our source code, datasets, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/MiuLab/FactAlign

Title: InfiniPot: Infinite Context Processing on Memory-Constrained LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01518
Summary: Handling long input contexts remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices. Our work aims to address this limitation by introducing InfiniPot, a novel KV cache control framework designed to enable pre-trained LLMs to manage extensive sequences within fixed memory constraints efficiently, without requiring additional training. InfiniPot leverages Continual Context Distillation (CCD), an iterative process that compresses and retains essential information through novel importance metrics, effectively maintaining critical data even without access to future context. Our comprehensive evaluations indicate that InfiniPot significantly outperforms models trained for long contexts in various NLP tasks, establishing its efficacy and versatility. This work represents a substantial advancement toward making LLMs applicable to a broader range of real-world scenarios.

Title: MOSEL: 950,000 Hours of Speech Data for Open-Source Speech Foundation Model Training on EU Languages
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01036
Summary: The rise of foundation models (FMs), coupled with regulatory efforts addressing their risks and impacts, has sparked significant interest in open-source models. However, existing speech FMs (SFMs) fall short of full compliance with the open-source principles, even if claimed otherwise, as no existing SFM has model weights, code, and training data publicly available under open-source terms. In this work, we take the first step toward filling this gap by focusing on the 24 official languages of the European Union (EU). We collect suitable training data by surveying automatic speech recognition datasets and unlabeled speech corpora under open-source compliant licenses, for a total of 950k hours. Additionally, we release automatic transcripts for 441k hours of unlabeled data under the permissive CC-BY license, thereby facilitating the creation of open-source SFMs for the EU languages.

Title: HarmoniCa: Harmonizing Training and Inference for Better Feature Cache in Diffusion Transformer Acceleration
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01723
Summary: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have gained prominence for outstanding scalability and extraordinary performance in generative tasks. However, their considerable inference costs impede practical deployment. The feature cache mechanism, which involves storing and retrieving redundant computations across timesteps, holds promise for reducing per-step inference time in diffusion models. Most existing caching methods for DiT are manually designed. Although the learning-based approach attempts to optimize strategies adaptively, it suffers from discrepancies between training and inference, which hampers both the performance and acceleration ratio. Upon detailed analysis, we pinpoint that these discrepancies primarily stem from two aspects: (1) Prior Timestep Disregard, where training ignores the effect of cache usage at earlier timesteps, and (2) Objective Mismatch, where the training target (align predicted noise in each timestep) deviates from the goal of inference (generate the high-quality image). To alleviate these discrepancies, we propose HarmoniCa, a novel method that Harmonizes training and inference with a novel learning-based Caching framework built upon Step-Wise Denoising Training (SDT) and Image Error Proxy-Guided Objective (IEPO). Compared to the traditional training paradigm, the newly proposed SDT maintains the continuity of the denoising process, enabling the model to leverage information from prior timesteps during training, similar to the way it operates during inference. Furthermore, we design IEPO, which integrates an efficient proxy mechanism to approximate the final image error caused by reusing the cached feature. Therefore, IEPO helps balance final image quality and cache utilization, resolving the issue of training that only considers the impact of cache usage on the predicted output at each timestep.

Title: E.T. Bench: Towards Open-Ended Event-Level Video-Language Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18111
Summary: Recent advances in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated their great potential in general-purpose video understanding. To verify the significance of these models, a number of benchmarks have been proposed to diagnose their capabilities in different scenarios. However, existing benchmarks merely evaluate models through video-level question-answering, lacking fine-grained event-level assessment and task diversity. To fill this gap, we introduce E.T. Bench (Event-Level & Time-Sensitive Video Understanding Benchmark), a large-scale and high-quality benchmark for open-ended event-level video understanding. Categorized within a 3-level task taxonomy, E.T. Bench encompasses 7.3K samples under 12 tasks with 7K videos (251.4h total length) under 8 domains, providing comprehensive evaluations. We extensively evaluated 8 Image-LLMs and 12 Video-LLMs on our benchmark, and the results reveal that state-of-the-art models for coarse-level (video-level) understanding struggle to solve our fine-grained tasks, e.g., grounding event-of-interests within videos, largely due to the short video context length, improper time representations, and lack of multi-event training data. Focusing on these issues, we further propose a strong baseline model, E.T. Chat, together with an instruction-tuning dataset E.T. Instruct 164K tailored for fine-grained event-level understanding. Our simple but effective solution demonstrates superior performance in multiple scenarios.

Title: Selective Aggregation for Low-Rank Adaptation in Federated Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01463
Summary: We investigate LoRA in federated learning through the lens of the asymmetry analysis of the learned A and B matrices. In doing so, we uncover that A matrices are responsible for learning general knowledge, while B matrices focus on capturing client-specific knowledge. Based on this finding, we introduce Federated Share-A Low-Rank Adaptation (FedSA-LoRA), which employs two low-rank trainable matrices A and B to model the weight update, but only A matrices are shared with the server for aggregation. Moreover, we delve into the relationship between the learned A and B matrices in other LoRA variants, such as rsLoRA and VeRA, revealing a consistent pattern. Consequently, we extend our FedSA-LoRA method to these LoRA variants, resulting in FedSA-rsLoRA and FedSA-VeRA. In this way, we establish a general paradigm for integrating LoRA with FL, offering guidance for future work on subsequent LoRA variants combined with FL. Extensive experimental results on natural language understanding and generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Not All LLM Reasoners Are Created Equal
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01748
Summary: We study the depth of grade-school math (GSM) problem-solving capabilities of LLMs. To this end, we evaluate their performance on pairs of existing math word problems together so that the answer to the second problem depends on correctly answering the first problem. Our findings reveal a significant reasoning gap in most LLMs, that is performance difference between solving the compositional pairs and solving each question independently. This gap is more pronounced in smaller, more cost-efficient, and math-specialized models. Moreover, instruction-tuning recipes and code generation have varying effects across LLM sizes, while finetuning on GSM can lead to task overfitting. Our analysis indicates that large reasoning gaps are not because of test-set leakage, but due to distraction from additional context and poor second-hop reasoning. Overall, LLMs exhibit systematic differences in their reasoning abilities, despite what their performance on standard benchmarks indicates.

Title: Is Preference Alignment Always the Best Option to Enhance LLM-Based Translation? An Empirical Analysis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20059
Summary: Neural metrics for machine translation (MT) evaluation have become increasingly prominent due to their superior correlation with human judgments compared to traditional lexical metrics. Researchers have therefore utilized neural metrics through quality-informed decoding strategies, achieving better results than likelihood-based methods. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), preference-based alignment techniques have gained attention for their potential to enhance translation quality by optimizing model weights directly on preferences induced by quality estimators. This study focuses on Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) and conducts extensive experiments to evaluate the impact of preference-based alignment on translation quality. Our findings indicate that while CPO consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on high-quality data with regard to the alignment metric, it may lead to instability across downstream evaluation metrics, particularly between neural and lexical ones. Additionally, we demonstrate that relying solely on the base model for generating candidate translations achieves performance comparable to using multiple external systems, while ensuring better consistency across downstream metrics.

Title: 3DGS-DET: Empower 3D Gaussian Splatting with Boundary Guidance and Box-Focused Sampling for 3D Object Detection
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01647
Summary: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are widely used for novel-view synthesis and have been adapted for 3D Object Detection (3DOD), offering a promising approach to 3DOD through view-synthesis representation. However, NeRF faces inherent limitations: (i) limited representational capacity for 3DOD due to its implicit nature, and (ii) slow rendering speeds. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an explicit 3D representation that addresses these limitations. Inspired by these advantages, this paper introduces 3DGS into 3DOD for the first time, identifying two main challenges: (i) Ambiguous spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs: 3DGS primarily relies on 2D pixel-level supervision, resulting in unclear 3D spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs and poor differentiation between objects and background, which hinders 3DOD; (ii) Excessive background blobs: 2D images often include numerous background pixels, leading to densely reconstructed 3DGS with many noisy Gaussian blobs representing the background, negatively affecting detection. To tackle the challenge (i), we leverage the fact that 3DGS reconstruction is derived from 2D images, and propose an elegant and efficient solution by incorporating 2D Boundary Guidance to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of Gaussian blobs, resulting in clearer differentiation between objects and their background. To address the challenge (ii), we propose a Box-Focused Sampling strategy using 2D boxes to generate object probability distribution in 3D spaces, allowing effective probabilistic sampling in 3D to retain more object blobs and reduce noisy background blobs. Benefiting from our designs, our 3DGS-DET significantly outperforms the SOTA NeRF-based method, NeRF-Det, achieving improvements of +6.6 on mAP@0.25 and +8.1 on mAP@0.5 for the ScanNet dataset, and impressive +31.5 on mAP@0.25 for the ARKITScenes dataset.

Title: Quantifying Generalization Complexity for Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01769
Summary: While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their generalization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization, necessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce Scylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the generalization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from memorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term the generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical threshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on non-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs' generalization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity shifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization. Leveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs including both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and close-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation and establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.

Title: Closed-loop Long-horizon Robotic Planning via Equilibrium Sequence Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01440
Summary: In the endeavor to make autonomous robots take actions, task planning is a major challenge that requires translating high-level task descriptions into long-horizon action sequences. Despite recent advances in language model agents, they remain prone to planning errors and limited in their ability to plan ahead. To address these limitations in robotic planning, we advocate a self-refining scheme that iteratively refines a draft plan until an equilibrium is reached. Remarkably, this process can be optimized end-to-end from an analytical perspective without the need to curate additional verifiers or reward models, allowing us to train self-refining planners in a simple supervised learning fashion. Meanwhile, a nested equilibrium sequence modeling procedure is devised for efficient closed-loop planning that incorporates useful feedback from the environment (or an internal world model). Our method is evaluated on the VirtualHome-Env benchmark, showing advanced performance with better scaling for inference computation. Code is available at https://github.com/Singularity0104/equilibrium-planner.

Title: LEOPARD : A Vision Language Model For Text-Rich Multi-Image Tasks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01744
Summary: Text-rich images, where text serves as the central visual element guiding the overall understanding, are prevalent in real-world applications, such as presentation slides, scanned documents, and webpage snapshots. Tasks involving multiple text-rich images are especially challenging, as they require not only understanding the content of individual images but reasoning about inter-relationships and logical flows across multiple visual inputs. Despite the importance of these scenarios, current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to handle such tasks due to two key challenges: (1) the scarcity of high-quality instruction tuning datasets for text-rich multi-image scenarios, and (2) the difficulty in balancing image resolution with visual feature sequence length. To address these challenges, we propose \OurMethod, a MLLM designed specifically for handling vision-language tasks involving multiple text-rich images. First, we curated about one million high-quality multimodal instruction-tuning data, tailored to text-rich, multi-image scenarios. Second, we developed an adaptive high-resolution multi-image encoding module to dynamically optimize the allocation of visual sequence length based on the original aspect ratios and resolutions of the input images. Experiments across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate our model's superior capabilities in text-rich, multi-image evaluations and competitive performance in general domain evaluations.

Title: From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01215
Summary: While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

Title: EVER: Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering for Real-time View Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01804
Summary: We present Exact Volumetric Ellipsoid Rendering (EVER), a method for real-time differentiable emission-only volume rendering. Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of sim!30 FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.

Title: ComfyGen: Prompt-Adaptive Workflows for Text-to-Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01731
Summary: The practical use of text-to-image generation has evolved from simple, monolithic models to complex workflows that combine multiple specialized components. While workflow-based approaches can lead to improved image quality, crafting effective workflows requires significant expertise, owing to the large number of available components, their complex inter-dependence, and their dependence on the generation prompt. Here, we introduce the novel task of prompt-adaptive workflow generation, where the goal is to automatically tailor a workflow to each user prompt. We propose two LLM-based approaches to tackle this task: a tuning-based method that learns from user-preference data, and a training-free method that uses the LLM to select existing flows. Both approaches lead to improved image quality when compared to monolithic models or generic, prompt-independent workflows. Our work shows that prompt-dependent flow prediction offers a new pathway to improving text-to-image generation quality, complementing existing research directions in the field.

Title: HelpSteer2-Preference: Complementing Ratings with Preferences
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01257
Summary: Reward models are critical for aligning models to follow instructions, and are typically trained following one of two popular paradigms: Bradley-Terry style or Regression style. However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, we release preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, we propose a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling. A Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model tuned with this approach scores 94.1 on RewardBench, emerging top of more than 140 reward models as of 1 Oct 2024. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this reward model at aligning models to follow instructions in RLHF. We open-source this dataset (CC-BY-4.0 license) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2 and openly release the trained Reward Model at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward

Title: RATIONALYST: Pre-training Process-Supervision for Improving Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01044
Summary: The reasoning steps generated by LLMs might be incomplete, as they mimic logical leaps common in everyday communication found in their pre-training data: underlying rationales are frequently left implicit (unstated). To address this challenge, we introduce RATIONALYST, a model for process-supervision of reasoning based on pre-training on a vast collection of rationale annotations extracted from unlabeled data. We extract 79k rationales from web-scale unlabelled dataset (the Pile) and a combination of reasoning datasets with minimal human intervention. This web-scale pre-training for reasoning allows RATIONALYST to consistently generalize across diverse reasoning tasks, including mathematical, commonsense, scientific, and logical reasoning. Fine-tuned from LLaMa-3-8B, RATIONALYST improves the accuracy of reasoning by an average of 3.9% on 7 representative reasoning benchmarks. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to significantly larger verifiers like GPT-4 and similarly sized models fine-tuned on matching training sets.

Title: Embodied-RAG: General non-parametric Embodied Memory for Retrieval and Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18313
Summary: There is no limit to how much a robot might explore and learn, but all of that knowledge needs to be searchable and actionable. Within language research, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has become the workhouse of large-scale non-parametric knowledge, however existing techniques do not directly transfer to the embodied domain, which is multimodal, data is highly correlated, and perception requires abstraction.   To address these challenges, we introduce Embodied-RAG, a framework that enhances the foundational model of an embodied agent with a non-parametric memory system capable of autonomously constructing hierarchical knowledge for both navigation and language generation. Embodied-RAG handles a full range of spatial and semantic resolutions across diverse environments and query types, whether for a specific object or a holistic description of ambiance. At its core, Embodied-RAG's memory is structured as a semantic forest, storing language descriptions at varying levels of detail. This hierarchical organization allows the system to efficiently generate context-sensitive outputs across different robotic platforms. We demonstrate that Embodied-RAG effectively bridges RAG to the robotics domain, successfully handling over 200 explanation and navigation queries across 19 environments, highlighting its promise for general-purpose non-parametric system for embodied agents.

Title: What the Harm? Quantifying the Tangible Impact of Gender Bias in Machine Translation with a Human-centered Study
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00545
Summary: Gender bias in machine translation (MT) is recognized as an issue that can harm people and society. And yet, advancements in the field rarely involve people, the final MT users, or inform how they might be impacted by biased technologies. Current evaluations are often restricted to automatic methods, which offer an opaque estimate of what the downstream impact of gender disparities might be. We conduct an extensive human-centered study to examine if and to what extent bias in MT brings harms with tangible costs, such as quality of service gaps across women and men. To this aim, we collect behavioral data from 90 participants, who post-edited MT outputs to ensure correct gender translation. Across multiple datasets, languages, and types of users, our study shows that feminine post-editing demands significantly more technical and temporal effort, also corresponding to higher financial costs. Existing bias measurements, however, fail to reflect the found disparities. Our findings advocate for human-centered approaches that can inform the societal impact of bias.

Title: Visual Context Window Extension: A New Perspective for Long Video Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20018
Summary: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in short video understanding tasks but face great challenges when applied to long video understanding. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit outstanding capabilities in modeling long texts. Existing work attempts to address this issue by introducing long video-text pairs during training. However, these approaches require substantial computational and data resources. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of long video understanding from the perspective of context windows, aiming to apply LMMs to long video tasks without retraining on long video datasets. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of why pretrained LMMs struggle to understand lengthy video content, identifying that discrepancies between visual and language modalities lead to different context windows for visual and language tokens, making it difficult to directly extend the visual tokens to match the language context window. Based on this, we propose to adapt LMMs for long video understanding tasks by extending the visual context window, eliminating the need for retraining on large scalelong video datasets. To further mitigate the significant memory consumption caused by long sequences, we introduce a progressive pooling inference strategy that selectively adjusts the spatial resolution of frame embeddings, reducing the number of visual tokens while retaining important spatial information. Across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, our method consistently improves the performance as the number of video frames increases. On the MLVU benchmark, our method outperforms GPT-4o, even though our model size is only 7B. Additionally, in the 256-frame setting, our method reduces memory usage by approximately 45% compared to the baseline, without introducing any performance loss.

Title: SyntheOcc: Synthesize Geometric-Controlled Street View Images through 3D Semantic MPIs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00337
Summary: The advancement of autonomous driving is increasingly reliant on high-quality annotated datasets, especially in the task of 3D occupancy prediction, where the occupancy labels require dense 3D annotation with significant human effort. In this paper, we propose SyntheOcc, which denotes a diffusion model that Synthesize photorealistic and geometric-controlled images by conditioning Occupancy labels in driving scenarios. This yields an unlimited amount of diverse, annotated, and controllable datasets for applications like training perception models and simulation. SyntheOcc addresses the critical challenge of how to efficiently encode 3D geometric information as conditional input to a 2D diffusion model. Our approach innovatively incorporates 3D semantic multi-plane images (MPIs) to provide comprehensive and spatially aligned 3D scene descriptions for conditioning. As a result, SyntheOcc can generate photorealistic multi-view images and videos that faithfully align with the given geometric labels (semantics in 3D voxel space). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of SyntheOcc on the nuScenes dataset prove its effectiveness in generating controllable occupancy datasets that serve as an effective data augmentation to perception models.

Title: Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow: Towards Minimum MSE Photo-Realistic Image Restoration
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00418
Summary: Photo-realistic image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by distortion measures (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and by perceptual quality measures (e.g., FID, NIQE), where the desire is to attain the lowest possible distortion without compromising on perceptual quality. To achieve this goal, current methods typically attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to optimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual quality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned specifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a constraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the reconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent theoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally transporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution of the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm that approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts the posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image using a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport map. We investigate the theoretical utility of PMRF and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms previous methods on a variety of image restoration tasks.

Title: One Token to Seg Them All: Language Instructed Reasoning Segmentation in Videos
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19603
Summary: We introduce VideoLISA, a video-based multimodal large language model designed to tackle the problem of language-instructed reasoning segmentation in videos. Leveraging the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of large language models, and augmented by the Segment Anything Model, VideoLISA generates temporally consistent segmentation masks in videos based on language instructions. Existing image-based methods, such as LISA, struggle with video tasks due to the additional temporal dimension, which requires temporal dynamic understanding and consistent segmentation across frames. VideoLISA addresses these challenges by integrating a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy into the video-LLM, which balances temporal context and spatial detail within computational constraints. Additionally, we propose a One-Token-Seg-All approach using a specially designed <TRK> token, enabling the model to segment and track objects across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks, including our newly introduced ReasonVOS benchmark, demonstrate VideoLISA's superior performance in video object segmentation tasks involving complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object tracking. While optimized for videos, VideoLISA also shows promising generalization to image segmentation, revealing its potential as a unified foundation model for language-instructed object segmentation. Code and model will be available at: https://github.com/showlab/VideoLISA.

Title: Atlas-Chat: Adapting Large Language Models for Low-Resource Moroccan Arabic Dialect
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17912
Summary: We introduce Atlas-Chat, the first-ever collection of large language models specifically developed for dialectal Arabic. Focusing on Moroccan Arabic, also known as Darija, we construct our instruction dataset by consolidating existing Darija language resources, creating novel datasets both manually and synthetically, and translating English instructions with stringent quality control. Atlas-Chat-9B and 2B models, fine-tuned on the dataset, exhibit superior ability in following Darija instructions and performing standard NLP tasks. Notably, our models outperform both state-of-the-art and Arabic-specialized LLMs like LLaMa, Jais, and AceGPT, e.g., achieving a 13% performance boost over a larger 13B model on DarijaMMLU, in our newly introduced evaluation suite for Darija covering both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, we perform an experimental analysis of various fine-tuning strategies and base model choices to determine optimal configurations. All our resources are publicly accessible, and we believe our work offers comprehensive design methodologies of instruction-tuning for low-resource language variants, which are often neglected in favor of data-rich languages by contemporary LLMs.

Title: Illustrious: an Open Advanced Illustration Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19946
Summary: In this work, we share the insights for achieving state-of-the-art quality in our text-to-image anime image generative model, called Illustrious. To achieve high resolution, dynamic color range images, and high restoration ability, we focus on three critical approaches for model improvement. First, we delve into the significance of the batch size and dropout control, which enables faster learning of controllable token based concept activations. Second, we increase the training resolution of images, affecting the accurate depiction of character anatomy in much higher resolution, extending its generation capability over 20MP with proper methods. Finally, we propose the refined multi-level captions, covering all tags and various natural language captions as a critical factor for model development. Through extensive analysis and experiments, Illustrious demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of animation style, outperforming widely-used models in illustration domains, propelling easier customization and personalization with nature of open source. We plan to publicly release updated Illustrious model series sequentially as well as sustainable plans for improvements.

Title: Law of the Weakest Link: Cross Capabilities of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19951
Summary: The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on individual capabilities. However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which we term cross capabilities. To systematically explore this concept, we first define seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy. Building on these definitions, we introduce CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability. To ensure reliable evaluation, we involve expert annotators to assess 4,200 model responses, gathering 8,400 human ratings with detailed explanations to serve as reference examples. Our findings reveal that, in both static evaluations and attempts to enhance specific abilities, current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest component. Specifically, across 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models, 38 scores are lower than all individual capabilities, while 20 fall between strong and weak, but closer to the weaker ability. These results highlight the under-performance of LLMs in cross-capability tasks, making the identification and improvement of the weakest capabilities a critical priority for future research to optimize performance in complex, multi-dimensional scenarios.

Title: Flex3D: Feed-Forward 3D Generation With Flexible Reconstruction Model And Input View Curation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00890
Summary: Generating high-quality 3D content from text, single images, or sparse view images remains a challenging task with broad applications.Existing methods typically employ multi-view diffusion models to synthesize multi-view images, followed by a feed-forward process for 3D reconstruction. However, these approaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views, limiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading to suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality. To address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework capable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The first stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We employ a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion model to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of the target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these views based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and reliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated views are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a transformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of inputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane representation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation. Through extensive exploration of design and training strategies, we optimize FlexRM to achieve superior performance in both reconstruction and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Flex3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a user study winning rate of over 92% in 3D generation tasks when compared to several of the latest feed-forward 3D generative models.

Title: TPI-LLM: Serving 70B-scale LLMs Efficiently on Low-resource Edge Devices
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00531
Summary: Large model inference is shifting from cloud to edge due to concerns about the privacy of user interaction data. However, edge devices often struggle with limited computing power, memory, and bandwidth, requiring collaboration across multiple devices to run and speed up LLM inference. Pipeline parallelism, the mainstream solution, is inefficient for single-user scenarios, while tensor parallelism struggles with frequent communications. In this paper, we argue that tensor parallelism can be more effective than pipeline on low-resource devices, and present a compute- and memory-efficient tensor parallel inference system, named TPI-LLM, to serve 70B-scale models. TPI-LLM keeps sensitive raw data local in the users' devices and introduces a sliding window memory scheduler to dynamically manage layer weights during inference, with disk I/O latency overlapped with the computation and communication. This allows larger models to run smoothly on memory-limited devices. We analyze the communication bottleneck and find that link latency, not bandwidth, emerges as the main issue, so a star-based allreduce algorithm is implemented. Through extensive experiments on both emulated and real testbeds, TPI-LLM demonstrated over 80% less time-to-first-token and token latency compared to Accelerate, and over 90% compared to Transformers and Galaxy, while cutting the peak memory footprint of Llama 2-70B by 90%, requiring only 3.1 GB of memory for 70B-scale models.

Title: Helpful DoggyBot: Open-World Object Fetching using Legged Robots and Vision-Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00231
Summary: Learning-based methods have achieved strong performance for quadrupedal locomotion. However, several challenges prevent quadrupeds from learning helpful indoor skills that require interaction with environments and humans: lack of end-effectors for manipulation, limited semantic understanding using only simulation data, and low traversability and reachability in indoor environments. We present a system for quadrupedal mobile manipulation in indoor environments. It uses a front-mounted gripper for object manipulation, a low-level controller trained in simulation using egocentric depth for agile skills like climbing and whole-body tilting, and pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with a third-person fisheye and an egocentric RGB camera for semantic understanding and command generation. We evaluate our system in two unseen environments without any real-world data collection or training. Our system can zero-shot generalize to these environments and complete tasks, like following user's commands to fetch a randomly placed stuff toy after climbing over a queen-sized bed, with a 60% success rate.

Title: DressRecon: Freeform 4D Human Reconstruction from Monocular Video
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20563
Summary: We present a method to reconstruct time-consistent human body models from monocular videos, focusing on extremely loose clothing or handheld object interactions. Prior work in human reconstruction is either limited to tight clothing with no object interactions, or requires calibrated multi-view captures or personalized template scans which are costly to collect at scale. Our key insight for high-quality yet flexible reconstruction is the careful combination of generic human priors about articulated body shape (learned from large-scale training data) with video-specific articulated "bag-of-bones" deformation (fit to a single video via test-time optimization). We accomplish this by learning a neural implicit model that disentangles body versus clothing deformations as separate motion model layers. To capture subtle geometry of clothing, we leverage image-based priors such as human body pose, surface normals, and optical flow during optimization. The resulting neural fields can be extracted into time-consistent meshes, or further optimized as explicit 3D Gaussians for high-fidelity interactive rendering. On datasets with highly challenging clothing deformations and object interactions, DressRecon yields higher-fidelity 3D reconstructions than prior art.

Title: ACE: All-round Creator and Editor Following Instructions via Diffusion Transformer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00086
Summary: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative technology and have been found to be applicable in various scenarios. Most existing foundational diffusion models are primarily designed for text-guided visual generation and do not support multi-modal conditions, which are essential for many visual editing tasks. This limitation prevents these foundational diffusion models from serving as a unified model in the field of visual generation, like GPT-4 in the natural language processing field. In this work, we propose ACE, an All-round Creator and Editor, which achieves comparable performance compared to those expert models in a wide range of visual generation tasks. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a unified condition format termed Long-context Condition Unit (LCU), and propose a novel Transformer-based diffusion model that uses LCU as input, aiming for joint training across various generation and editing tasks. Furthermore, we propose an efficient data collection approach to address the issue of the absence of available training data. It involves acquiring pairwise images with synthesis-based or clustering-based pipelines and supplying these pairs with accurate textual instructions by leveraging a fine-tuned multi-modal large language model. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our model, we establish a benchmark of manually annotated pairs data across a variety of visual generation tasks. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model in visual generation fields. Thanks to the all-in-one capabilities of our model, we can easily build a multi-modal chat system that responds to any interactive request for image creation using a single model to serve as the backend, avoiding the cumbersome pipeline typically employed in visual agents. Code and models will be available on the project page: https://ali-vilab.github.io/ace-page/.

Title: Addition is All You Need for Energy-efficient Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00907
Summary: Large neural networks spend most computation on floating point tensor multiplications. In this work, we find that a floating point multiplier can be approximated by one integer adder with high precision. We propose the linear-complexity multiplication L-Mul algorithm that approximates floating point number multiplication with integer addition operations. The new algorithm costs significantly less computation resource than 8-bit floating point multiplication but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point multiplications, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes significantly less bit-level computation. Since multiplying floating point numbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition operations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can potentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor multiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products. We calculated the theoretical error expectation of L-Mul, and evaluated the algorithm on a wide range of textual, visual, and symbolic tasks, including natural language understanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question answering. Our numerical analysis experiments agree with the theoretical error estimation, which indicates that L-Mul with 4-bit mantissa achieves comparable precision as float8_e4m3 multiplications, and L-Mul with 3-bit mantissa outperforms float8_e5m2. Evaluation results on popular benchmarks show that directly applying L-Mul to the attention mechanism is almost lossless. We further show that replacing all floating point multiplications with 3-bit mantissa L-Mul in a transformer model achieves equivalent precision as using float8_e4m3 as accumulation precision in both fine-tuning and inference.

Title: Visual Question Decomposition on Multimodal Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19339
Summary: Question decomposition has emerged as an effective strategy for prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer complex questions. However, while existing methods primarily focus on unimodal language models, the question decomposition capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has yet to be explored. To this end, this paper explores visual question decomposition on MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework including a dataset and several evaluation criteria to assess the quality of the decomposed sub-questions, revealing that existing MLLMs struggle to produce high-quality sub-questions. To address this limitation, we propose a specific finetuning dataset, DecoVQA+, for enhancing the model's question decomposition capability. Aiming at enabling models to perform appropriate selective decomposition, we propose an efficient finetuning pipeline. The finetuning pipeline consists of our proposed dataset and a training objective for selective decomposition. Finetuned MLLMs demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of sub-questions and the policy of selective question decomposition. Additionally, the models also achieve higher accuracy with selective decomposition on VQA benchmark datasets.

Title: Scaling Proprioceptive-Visual Learning with Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20537
Summary: One of the roadblocks for training generalist robotic models today is heterogeneity. Previous robot learning methods often collect data to train with one specific embodiment for one task, which is expensive and prone to overfitting. This work studies the problem of learning policy representations through heterogeneous pre-training on robot data across different embodiments and tasks at scale. We propose Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers (HPT), which pre-train a large, shareable trunk of a policy neural network to learn a task and embodiment agnostic shared representation. This general architecture aligns the specific proprioception and vision inputs from distinct embodiments to a short sequence of tokens and then processes such tokens to map to control robots for different tasks. Leveraging the recent large-scale multi-embodiment real-world robotic datasets as well as simulation, deployed robots, and human video datasets, we investigate pre-training policies across heterogeneity. We conduct experiments to investigate the scaling behaviors of training objectives, to the extent of 52 datasets. HPTs outperform several baselines and enhance the fine-tuned policy performance by over 20% on unseen tasks in multiple simulator benchmarks and real-world settings. See the project website (https://liruiw.github.io/hpt/) for code and videos.

Title: UniAff: A Unified Representation of Affordances for Tool Usage and Articulation with Vision-Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20551
Summary: Previous studies on robotic manipulation are based on a limited understanding of the underlying 3D motion constraints and affordances. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive paradigm, termed UniAff, that integrates 3D object-centric manipulation and task understanding in a unified formulation. Specifically, we constructed a dataset labeled with manipulation-related key attributes, comprising 900 articulated objects from 19 categories and 600 tools from 12 categories. Furthermore, we leverage MLLMs to infer object-centric representations for manipulation tasks, including affordance recognition and reasoning about 3D motion constraints. Comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings indicate that UniAff significantly improves the generalization of robotic manipulation for tools and articulated objects. We hope that UniAff will serve as a general baseline for unified robotic manipulation tasks in the future. Images, videos, dataset, and code are published on the project website at:https://sites.google.com/view/uni-aff/home

Title: Ruler: A Model-Agnostic Method to Control Generated Length for Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18943
Summary: The instruction-following ability of large language models enables humans to interact with AI agents in a natural way. However, when required to generate responses of a specific length, large language models often struggle to meet users' needs due to their inherent difficulty in accurately perceiving numerical constraints. To explore the ability of large language models to control the length of generated responses, we propose the Target Length Generation Task (TLG) and design two metrics, Precise Match (PM) and Flexible Match (FM) to evaluate the model's performance in adhering to specified response lengths. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, model-agnostic approach called Ruler, which employs Meta Length Tokens (MLTs) to enhance the instruction-following ability of large language models under length-constrained instructions. Specifically, Ruler equips LLMs with the ability to generate responses of a specified length based on length constraints within the instructions. Moreover, Ruler can automatically generate appropriate MLT when length constraints are not explicitly provided, demonstrating excellent versatility and generalization. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of Ruler across different LLMs on Target Length Generation Task, e.g., at All Level 27.97 average gain on PM, 29.57 average gain on FM. In addition, we conduct extensive ablation experiments to further substantiate the efficacy and generalization of Ruler. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/Geaming2002/Ruler.

Title: Coffee-Gym: An Environment for Evaluating and Improving Natural Language Feedback on Erroneous Code
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19715
Summary: This paper presents Coffee-Gym, a comprehensive RL environment for training models that provide feedback on code editing. Coffee-Gym includes two major components: (1) Coffee, a dataset containing humans' code edit traces for coding questions and machine-written feedback for editing erroneous code; (2) CoffeeEval, a reward function that faithfully reflects the helpfulness of feedback by assessing the performance of the revised code in unit tests. With them, Coffee-Gym addresses the unavailability of high-quality datasets for training feedback models with RL, and provides more accurate rewards than the SOTA reward model (i.e., GPT-4). By applying Coffee-Gym, we elicit feedback models that outperform baselines in enhancing open-source code LLMs' code editing, making them comparable with closed-source LLMs. We make the dataset and the model checkpoint publicly available.

Title: Can Models Learn Skill Composition from Examples?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19808
Summary: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly advanced, their ability to exhibit compositional generalization -- the capacity to combine learned skills in novel ways not encountered during training -- has garnered significant attention. This type of generalization, particularly in scenarios beyond training data, is also of great interest in the study of AI safety and alignment. A recent study introduced the SKILL-MIX evaluation, where models are tasked with composing a short paragraph demonstrating the use of a specified k-tuple of language skills. While small models struggled with composing even with k=3, larger models like GPT-4 performed reasonably well with k=5 and 6.   In this paper, we employ a setup akin to SKILL-MIX to evaluate the capacity of smaller models to learn compositional generalization from examples. Utilizing a diverse set of language skills -- including rhetorical, literary, reasoning, theory of mind, and common sense -- GPT-4 was used to generate text samples that exhibit random subsets of k skills. Subsequent fine-tuning of 7B and 13B parameter models on these combined skill texts, for increasing values of k, revealed the following findings: (1) Training on combinations of k=2 and 3 skills results in noticeable improvements in the ability to compose texts with k=4 and 5 skills, despite models never having seen such examples during training. (2) When skill categories are split into training and held-out groups, models significantly improve at composing texts with held-out skills during testing despite having only seen training skills during fine-tuning, illustrating the efficacy of the training approach even with previously unseen skills. This study also suggests that incorporating skill-rich (potentially synthetic) text into training can substantially enhance the compositional capabilities of models.

Title: IDEAW: Robust Neural Audio Watermarking with Invertible Dual-Embedding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19627
Summary: The audio watermarking technique embeds messages into audio and accurately extracts messages from the watermarked audio. Traditional methods develop algorithms based on expert experience to embed watermarks into the time-domain or transform-domain of signals. With the development of deep neural networks, deep learning-based neural audio watermarking has emerged. Compared to traditional algorithms, neural audio watermarking achieves better robustness by considering various attacks during training. However, current neural watermarking methods suffer from low capacity and unsatisfactory imperceptibility. Additionally, the issue of watermark locating, which is extremely important and even more pronounced in neural audio watermarking, has not been adequately studied. In this paper, we design a dual-embedding watermarking model for efficient locating. We also consider the impact of the attack layer on the invertible neural network in robustness training, improving the model to enhance both its reasonableness and stability. Experiments show that the proposed model, IDEAW, can withstand various attacks with higher capacity and more efficient locating ability compared to existing methods.

Title: Cottention: Linear Transformers With Cosine Attention
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18747
Summary: Attention mechanisms, particularly softmax attention, have been instrumental in the success of transformer-based models such as GPT. However, the quadratic memory complexity of softmax attention with respect to sequence length poses significant challenges for processing longer sequences. We introduce Cottention, a novel attention mechanism that replaces the softmax operation with cosine similarity. By leveraging the properties of cosine similarity and rearranging the attention equation, Cottention achieves native linear memory complexity with respect to sequence length, making it inherently more memory-efficient than softmax attention. We demonstrate that Cottention can be reformulated as a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a finite hidden state, allowing for constant memory usage during inference. We evaluate Cottention on both the bidirectional BERT and causal GPT tasks, demonstrating comparable performance to softmax attention while significantly reducing memory requirements. To ensure efficient computation, we develop a custom CUDA kernel for Cottention. Our results show that Cottention is a promising alternative to softmax attention, enabling the processing of longer sequences without sacrificing performance, due to its native linear memory complexity and ability to maintain a constant memory footprint during inference.

Title: MM1.5: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Fine-tuning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20566
Summary: We present MM1.5, a new family of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) designed to enhance capabilities in text-rich image understanding, visual referring and grounding, and multi-image reasoning. Building upon the MM1 architecture, MM1.5 adopts a data-centric approach to model training, systematically exploring the impact of diverse data mixtures across the entire model training lifecycle. This includes high-quality OCR data and synthetic captions for continual pre-training, as well as an optimized visual instruction-tuning data mixture for supervised fine-tuning. Our models range from 1B to 30B parameters, encompassing both dense and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, and demonstrate that careful data curation and training strategies can yield strong performance even at small scales (1B and 3B). Additionally, we introduce two specialized variants: MM1.5-Video, designed for video understanding, and MM1.5-UI, tailored for mobile UI understanding. Through extensive empirical studies and ablations, we provide detailed insights into the training processes and decisions that inform our final designs, offering valuable guidance for future research in MLLM development.

Title: Hyper-Connections
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19606
Summary: We present hyper-connections, a simple yet effective method that can serve as an alternative to residual connections. This approach specifically addresses common drawbacks observed in residual connection variants, such as the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. Theoretically, hyper-connections allow the network to adjust the strength of connections between features at different depths and dynamically rearrange layers. We conduct experiments focusing on the pre-training of large language models, including dense and sparse models, where hyper-connections show significant performance improvements over residual connections. Additional experiments conducted on vision tasks also demonstrate similar improvements. We anticipate that this method will be broadly applicable and beneficial across a wide range of AI problems.

Title: DiaSynth -- Synthetic Dialogue Generation Framework
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19020
Summary: The scarcity of domain specific dialogue datasets across various domains, from academic topics to everyday conversations, limits the development of dialogue systems for various applications. Existing research is often constrained either by dialogue datasets that are too general or by niche domain dialogue datasets whose scale does not match the required scale for training dialogue systems. To address this gap, we introduce DiaSynth - a synthetic dialogue generation framework capable of generating high quality, contextually rich dialogues across a wide range of domains. Our approach differs from existing frameworks by dynamically generating dialogues that incorporate simulated personas, subtopics, and diverse conversational characteristics, using a Large Language Model (LLM) with Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to create contextually rich, domain-specific dialogues that closely mimic natural human interactions. DiaSynth produces tailored dialogues that emulate realistic conversations. We perform our experiments by generating synthetic data using different LLMs and few-shot examples from DialogSum and SAMSum. The pretrained language models fine-tuned on the synthetic data outperform the base models by 16.47%, while the comparison between models fine-tuned on in-domain data and synthetic data shows that the synthetic data is able to capture 90.48% of the distribution of the in-domain data. The quality of the data generated also scales with the size of LLMs. These results validate DiaSynth's potential as a robust alternative to traditional data collection methods.

Title: Image Copy Detection for Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19952
Summary: Images produced by diffusion models are increasingly popular in digital artwork and visual marketing. However, such generated images might replicate content from existing ones and pose the challenge of content originality. Existing Image Copy Detection (ICD) models, though accurate in detecting hand-crafted replicas, overlook the challenge from diffusion models. This motivates us to introduce ICDiff, the first ICD specialized for diffusion models. To this end, we construct a Diffusion-Replication (D-Rep) dataset and correspondingly propose a novel deep embedding method. D-Rep uses a state-of-the-art diffusion model (Stable Diffusion V1.5) to generate 40, 000 image-replica pairs, which are manually annotated into 6 replication levels ranging from 0 (no replication) to 5 (total replication). Our method, PDF-Embedding, transforms the replication level of each image-replica pair into a probability density function (PDF) as the supervision signal. The intuition is that the probability of neighboring replication levels should be continuous and smooth. Experimental results show that PDF-Embedding surpasses protocol-driven methods and non-PDF choices on the D-Rep test set. Moreover, by utilizing PDF-Embedding, we find that the replication ratios of well-known diffusion models against an open-source gallery range from 10% to 20%.
