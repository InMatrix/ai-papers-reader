Title: Text-Driven Neural Collaborative Filtering Model for Paper Source Tracing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17722
Summary: Identifying significant references within the complex interrelations of a citation knowledge graph is challenging, which encompasses connections through citations, authorship, keywords, and other relational attributes. The Paper Source Tracing (PST) task seeks to automate the identification of pivotal references for given scholarly articles utilizing advanced data mining techniques. In the KDD CUP 2024, we design a recommendation-based framework tailored for the PST task. This framework employs the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model to generate final predictions. To process the textual attributes of the papers and extract input features for the model, we utilize SciBERT, a pre-trained language model. According to the experimental results, our method achieved a score of 0.37814 on the Mean Average Precision (MAP) metric, outperforming baseline models and ranking 11th among all participating teams.

Title: LKCell: Efficient Cell Nuclei Instance Segmentation with Large Convolution Kernels
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18054
Summary: The segmentation of cell nuclei in tissue images stained with the blood dye hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) is essential for various clinical applications and analyses. Due to the complex characteristics of cellular morphology, a large receptive field is considered crucial for generating high-quality segmentation. However, previous methods face challenges in achieving a balance between the receptive field and computational burden. To address this issue, we propose LKCell, a high-accuracy and efficient cell segmentation method. Its core insight lies in unleashing the potential of large convolution kernels to achieve computationally efficient large receptive fields. Specifically, (1) We transfer pre-trained large convolution kernel models to the medical domain for the first time, demonstrating their effectiveness in cell segmentation. (2) We analyze the redundancy of previous methods and design a new segmentation decoder based on large convolution kernels. It achieves higher performance while significantly reducing the number of parameters. We evaluate our method on the most challenging benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results (0.5080 mPQ) in cell nuclei instance segmentation with only 21.6% FLOPs compared with the previous leading method. Our source code and models are available at https://github.com/hustvl/LKCell.

Title: The FIGNEWS Shared Task on News Media Narratives
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18147
Summary: We present an overview of the FIGNEWS shared task, organized as part of the ArabicNLP 2024 conference co-located with ACL 2024. The shared task addresses bias and propaganda annotation in multilingual news posts. We focus on the early days of the Israel War on Gaza as a case study. The task aims to foster collaboration in developing annotation guidelines for subjective tasks by creating frameworks for analyzing diverse narratives highlighting potential bias and propaganda. In a spirit of fostering and encouraging diversity, we address the problem from a multilingual perspective, namely within five languages: English, French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Hindi. A total of 17 teams participated in two annotation subtasks: bias (16 teams) and propaganda (6 teams). The teams competed in four evaluation tracks: guidelines development, annotation quality, annotation quantity, and consistency. Collectively, the teams produced 129,800 data points. Key findings and implications for the field are discussed.

Title: Dallah: A Dialect-Aware Multimodal Large Language Model for Arabic
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18129
Summary: Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in generating and understanding image-to-text content. Despite these successes, progress is predominantly limited to English due to the scarcity of high quality multimodal resources in other languages. This limitation impedes the development of competitive models in languages such as Arabic. To alleviate this situation, we introduce an efficient Arabic multimodal assistant, dubbed Dallah, that utilizes an advanced language model based on LLaMA-2 to facilitate multimodal interactions. Dallah demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Arabic MLLMs. Through fine-tuning six Arabic dialects, Dallah showcases its capability to handle complex dialectal interactions incorporating both textual and visual elements. The model excels in two benchmark tests: one evaluating its performance on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and another specifically designed to assess dialectal responses. Beyond its robust performance in multimodal interaction tasks, Dallah has the potential to pave the way for further development of dialect-aware Arabic MLLMs.

Title: Efficient Inference of Vision Instruction-Following Models with Elastic Cache
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18121
Summary: In the field of instruction-following large vision-language models (LVLMs), the efficient deployment of these models faces challenges, notably due to the high memory demands of their key-value (KV) caches. Conventional cache management strategies for LLMs focus on cache eviction, which often fails to address the specific needs of multimodal instruction-following models. Recognizing this gap, in this paper, we introduce Elastic Cache, a novel approach that benefits from applying distinct acceleration methods for instruction encoding and output generation stages. We investigate the metrics of importance in different stages and propose an importance-driven cache merging strategy to prune redundancy caches. Instead of discarding less important caches, our strategy identifies important key/value vectors as anchor points. Surrounding less important caches are then merged with these anchors, enhancing the preservation of contextual information in the KV caches while yielding an arbitrary acceleration ratio. For instruction encoding, we utilize the frequency to evaluate the importance of caches. Regarding output generation, we prioritize tokens based on their distance with an offset, by which both the initial and most recent tokens are retained. Results on a range of LVLMs demonstrate that Elastic Cache not only boosts efficiency but also notably outperforms existing pruning methods in language generation across various tasks.

Title: Data Mixture Inference: What do BPE Tokenizers Reveal about their Training Data?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16607
Summary: The pretraining data of today's strongest language models is opaque. In particular, little is known about the proportions of various domains or languages represented. In this work, we tackle a task which we call data mixture inference, which aims to uncover the distributional make-up of training data. We introduce a novel attack based on a previously overlooked source of information -- byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizers, used by the vast majority of modern language models. Our key insight is that the ordered list of merge rules learned by a BPE tokenizer naturally reveals information about the token frequencies in its training data: the first merge is the most common byte pair, the second is the most common pair after merging the first token, and so on. Given a tokenizer's merge list along with data samples for each category of interest, we formulate a linear program that solves for the proportion of each category in the tokenizer's training set. Importantly, to the extent to which tokenizer training data is representative of the pretraining data, we indirectly learn about the pretraining data. In controlled experiments, we show that our attack recovers mixture ratios with high precision for tokenizers trained on known mixtures of natural languages, programming languages, and data sources. We then apply our approach to off-the-shelf tokenizers released with recent LMs. We confirm much publicly disclosed information about these models, and also make several new inferences: GPT-4o's tokenizer is much more multilingual than its predecessors, training on 39% non-English data; Llama3 extends GPT-3.5's tokenizer primarily for multilingual (48%) use; GPT-3.5's and Claude's tokenizers are trained on predominantly code (~60%). We hope our work sheds light on current design practices for pretraining data, and inspires continued research into data mixture inference for LMs.

Title: Course-Correction: Safety Alignment Using Synthetic Preferences
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16637
Summary: The risk of harmful content generated by large language models (LLMs) becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a systematic study on assessing and improving LLMs' capability to perform the task of course-correction, \ie, the model can steer away from generating harmful content autonomously. To start with, we introduce the C^2-Eval benchmark for quantitative assessment and analyze 10 popular LLMs, revealing varying proficiency of current safety-tuned LLMs in course-correction. To improve, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with preference learning, emphasizing the preference for timely course-correction. Using an automated pipeline, we create C^2-Syn, a synthetic dataset with 750K pairwise preferences, to teach models the concept of timely course-correction through data-driven preference learning. Experiments on 2 LLMs, Llama2-Chat 7B and Qwen2 7B, show that our method effectively enhances course-correction skills without affecting general performance. Additionally, it effectively improves LLMs' safety, particularly in resisting jailbreak attacks.

Title: BetterDepth: Plug-and-Play Diffusion Refiner for Zero-Shot Monocular Depth Estimation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17952
Summary: By training over large-scale datasets, zero-shot monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods show robust performance in the wild but often suffer from insufficiently precise details. Although recent diffusion-based MDE approaches exhibit appealing detail extraction ability, they still struggle in geometrically challenging scenes due to the difficulty of gaining robust geometric priors from diverse datasets. To leverage the complementary merits of both worlds, we propose BetterDepth to efficiently achieve geometrically correct affine-invariant MDE performance while capturing fine-grained details. Specifically, BetterDepth is a conditional diffusion-based refiner that takes the prediction from pre-trained MDE models as depth conditioning, in which the global depth context is well-captured, and iteratively refines details based on the input image. For the training of such a refiner, we propose global pre-alignment and local patch masking methods to ensure the faithfulness of BetterDepth to depth conditioning while learning to capture fine-grained scene details. By efficient training on small-scale synthetic datasets, BetterDepth achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot MDE performance on diverse public datasets and in-the-wild scenes. Moreover, BetterDepth can improve the performance of other MDE models in a plug-and-play manner without additional re-training.

Title: Very Large-Scale Multi-Agent Simulation in AgentScope
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17789
Summary: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for applying multi-agent systems in very large-scale simulations. However, there remain several challenges when conducting multi-agent simulations with existing platforms, such as limited scalability and low efficiency, unsatisfied agent diversity, and effort-intensive management processes. To address these challenges, we develop several new features and components for AgentScope, a user-friendly multi-agent platform, enhancing its convenience and flexibility for supporting very large-scale multi-agent simulations. Specifically, we propose an actor-based distributed mechanism as the underlying technological infrastructure towards great scalability and high efficiency, and provide flexible environment support for simulating various real-world scenarios, which enables parallel execution of multiple agents, centralized workflow orchestration, and both inter-agent and agent-environment interactions among agents. Moreover, we integrate an easy-to-use configurable tool and an automatic background generation pipeline in AgentScope, simplifying the process of creating agents with diverse yet detailed background settings. Last but not least, we provide a web-based interface for conveniently monitoring and managing a large number of agents that might deploy across multiple devices. We conduct a comprehensive simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements in AgentScope, and provide detailed observations and discussions to highlight the great potential of applying multi-agent systems in large-scale simulations. The source code is released on GitHub at https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope to inspire further research and development in large-scale multi-agent simulations.

Title: LAMBDA: A Large Model Based Data Agent
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17535
Summary: We introduce ``LAMBDA," a novel open-source, code-free multi-agent data analysis system that that harnesses the power of large models. LAMBDA is designed to address data analysis challenges in complex data-driven applications through the use of innovatively designed data agents that operate iteratively and generatively using natural language. At the core of LAMBDA are two key agent roles: the programmer and the inspector, which are engineered to work together seamlessly. Specifically, the programmer generates code based on the user's instructions and domain-specific knowledge, enhanced by advanced models. Meanwhile, the inspector debugs the code when necessary. To ensure robustness and handle adverse scenarios, LAMBDA features a user interface that allows direct user intervention in the operational loop. Additionally, LAMBDA can flexibly integrate external models and algorithms through our knowledge integration mechanism, catering to the needs of customized data analysis. LAMBDA has demonstrated strong performance on various machine learning datasets. It has the potential to enhance data science practice and analysis paradigm by seamlessly integrating human and artificial intelligence, making it more accessible, effective, and efficient for individuals from diverse backgrounds. The strong performance of LAMBDA in solving data science problems is demonstrated in several case studies, which are presented at https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/cmfai/lambda.html.

Title: Diffree: Text-Guided Shape Free Object Inpainting with Diffusion Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16982
Summary: This paper addresses an important problem of object addition for images with only text guidance. It is challenging because the new object must be integrated seamlessly into the image with consistent visual context, such as lighting, texture, and spatial location. While existing text-guided image inpainting methods can add objects, they either fail to preserve the background consistency or involve cumbersome human intervention in specifying bounding boxes or user-scribbled masks. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Diffree, a Text-to-Image (T2I) model that facilitates text-guided object addition with only text control. To this end, we curate OABench, an exquisite synthetic dataset by removing objects with advanced image inpainting techniques. OABench comprises 74K real-world tuples of an original image, an inpainted image with the object removed, an object mask, and object descriptions. Trained on OABench using the Stable Diffusion model with an additional mask prediction module, Diffree uniquely predicts the position of the new object and achieves object addition with guidance from only text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Diffree excels in adding new objects with a high success rate while maintaining background consistency, spatial appropriateness, and object relevance and quality.

Title: AMEX: Android Multi-annotation Expo Dataset for Mobile GUI Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17490
Summary: AI agents have drawn increasing attention mostly on their ability to perceive environments, understand tasks, and autonomously achieve goals. To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents. Their capabilities of completing complex tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices are trained and evaluated with the proposed dataset. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from 110 popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing mobile device-control datasets, e.g., MoTIF, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions, each averaging 13 steps with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally, we develop a baseline model SPHINX Agent and compare its performance across state-of-the-art agents trained on other datasets. To facilitate further research, we open-source our dataset, models, and relevant evaluation tools. The project is available at https://yuxiangchai.github.io/AMEX/

Title: DistilDIRE: A Small, Fast, Cheap and Lightweight Diffusion Synthesized Deepfake Detection
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00856
Summary: A dramatic influx of diffusion-generated images has marked recent years, posing unique challenges to current detection technologies. While the task of identifying these images falls under binary classification, a seemingly straightforward category, the computational load is significant when employing the "reconstruction then compare" technique. This approach, known as DIRE (Diffusion Reconstruction Error), not only identifies diffusion-generated images but also detects those produced by GANs, highlighting the technique's broad applicability. To address the computational challenges and improve efficiency, we propose distilling the knowledge embedded in diffusion models to develop rapid deepfake detection models. Our approach, aimed at creating a small, fast, cheap, and lightweight diffusion synthesized deepfake detector, maintains robust performance while significantly reducing operational demands. Maintaining performance, our experimental results indicate an inference speed 3.2 times faster than the existing DIRE framework. This advance not only enhances the practicality of deploying these systems in real-world settings but also paves the way for future research endeavors that seek to leverage diffusion model knowledge.

Title: Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14207
Summary: The most fundamental capability of modern AI methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is the ability to predict the next token in a long sequence of tokens, known as ``sequence modeling." Although the Transformers model is the current dominant approach to sequence modeling, its quadratic computational cost with respect to sequence length is a significant drawback. State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.

Title: MOMAland: A Set of Benchmarks for Multi-Objective Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16312
Summary: Many challenging tasks such as managing traffic systems, electricity grids, or supply chains involve complex decision-making processes that must balance multiple conflicting objectives and coordinate the actions of various independent decision-makers (DMs). One perspective for formalising and addressing such tasks is multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MOMARL). MOMARL broadens reinforcement learning (RL) to problems with multiple agents each needing to consider multiple objectives in their learning process. In reinforcement learning research, benchmarks are crucial in facilitating progress, evaluation, and reproducibility. The significance of benchmarks is underscored by the existence of numerous benchmark frameworks developed for various RL paradigms, including single-agent RL (e.g., Gymnasium), multi-agent RL (e.g., PettingZoo), and single-agent multi-objective RL (e.g., MO-Gymnasium). To support the advancement of the MOMARL field, we introduce MOMAland, the first collection of standardised environments for multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning. MOMAland addresses the need for comprehensive benchmarking in this emerging field, offering over 10 diverse environments that vary in the number of agents, state representations, reward structures, and utility considerations. To provide strong baselines for future research, MOMAland also includes algorithms capable of learning policies in such settings.

Title: Learning to Manipulate Anywhere: A Visual Generalizable Framework For Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15815
Summary: Can we endow visuomotor robots with generalization capabilities to operate in diverse open-world scenarios? In this paper, we propose Maniwhere, a generalizable framework tailored for visual reinforcement learning, enabling the trained robot policies to generalize across a combination of multiple visual disturbance types. Specifically, we introduce a multi-view representation learning approach fused with Spatial Transformer Network (STN) module to capture shared semantic information and correspondences among different viewpoints. In addition, we employ a curriculum-based randomization and augmentation approach to stabilize the RL training process and strengthen the visual generalization ability. To exhibit the effectiveness of Maniwhere, we meticulously design 8 tasks encompassing articulate objects, bi-manual, and dexterous hand manipulation tasks, demonstrating Maniwhere's strong visual generalization and sim2real transfer abilities across 3 hardware platforms. Our experiments show that Maniwhere significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Videos are provided at https://gemcollector.github.io/maniwhere/.

Title: DreamCar: Leveraging Car-specific Prior for in-the-wild 3D Car Reconstruction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16988
Summary: Self-driving industries usually employ professional artists to build exquisite 3D cars. However, it is expensive to craft large-scale digital assets. Since there are already numerous datasets available that contain a vast number of images of cars, we focus on reconstructing high-quality 3D car models from these datasets. However, these datasets only contain one side of cars in the forward-moving scene. We try to use the existing generative models to provide more supervision information, but they struggle to generalize well in cars since they are trained on synthetic datasets not car-specific. In addition, The reconstructed 3D car texture misaligns due to a large error in camera pose estimation when dealing with in-the-wild images. These restrictions make it challenging for previous methods to reconstruct complete 3D cars. To address these problems, we propose a novel method, named DreamCar, which can reconstruct high-quality 3D cars given a few images even a single image. To generalize the generative model, we collect a car dataset, named Car360, with over 5,600 vehicles. With this dataset, we make the generative model more robust to cars. We use this generative prior specific to the car to guide its reconstruction via Score Distillation Sampling. To further complement the supervision information, we utilize the geometric and appearance symmetry of cars. Finally, we propose a pose optimization method that rectifies poses to tackle texture misalignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstructing high-quality 3D cars. https://xiaobiaodu.github.io/dreamcar-project/{Our code is available.}

Title: HumanVid: Demystifying Training Data for Camera-controllable Human Image Animation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17438
Summary: Human image animation involves generating videos from a character photo, allowing user control and unlocking potential for video and movie production. While recent approaches yield impressive results using high-quality training data, the inaccessibility of these datasets hampers fair and transparent benchmarking. Moreover, these approaches prioritize 2D human motion and overlook the significance of camera motions in videos, leading to limited control and unstable video generation.To demystify the training data, we present HumanVid, the first large-scale high-quality dataset tailored for human image animation, which combines crafted real-world and synthetic data. For the real-world data, we compile a vast collection of copyright-free real-world videos from the internet. Through a carefully designed rule-based filtering strategy, we ensure the inclusion of high-quality videos, resulting in a collection of 20K human-centric videos in 1080P resolution. Human and camera motion annotation is accomplished using a 2D pose estimator and a SLAM-based method. For the synthetic data, we gather 2,300 copyright-free 3D avatar assets to augment existing available 3D assets. Notably, we introduce a rule-based camera trajectory generation method, enabling the synthetic pipeline to incorporate diverse and precise camera motion annotation, which can rarely be found in real-world data. To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a baseline model named CamAnimate, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation, that considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our HumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose and camera motions, setting a new benchmark. Code and data will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhenzhiwang/HumanVid/.

Title: PERSONA: A Reproducible Testbed for Pluralistic Alignment
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17387
Summary: The rapid advancement of language models (LMs) necessitates robust alignment with diverse user values. However, current preference optimization approaches often fail to capture the plurality of user opinions, instead reinforcing majority viewpoints and marginalizing minority perspectives. We introduce PERSONA, a reproducible test bed designed to evaluate and improve pluralistic alignment of LMs. We procedurally generate diverse user profiles from US census data, resulting in 1,586 synthetic personas with varied demographic and idiosyncratic attributes. We then generate a large-scale evaluation dataset containing 3,868 prompts and 317,200 feedback pairs obtained from our synthetic personas. Leveraging this dataset, we systematically evaluate LM capabilities in role-playing diverse users, verified through human judges, and the establishment of both a benchmark, PERSONA Bench, for pluralistic alignment approaches as well as an extensive dataset to create new and future benchmarks. The full dataset and benchmarks are available here: https://www.synthlabs.ai/research/persona.

Title: $VILA^2$: VILA Augmented VILA
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17453
Summary: Visual language models (VLMs) have rapidly progressed, driven by the success of large language models (LLMs). While model architectures and training infrastructures advance rapidly, data curation remains under-explored. When data quantity and quality become a bottleneck, existing work either directly crawls more raw data from the Internet that does not have a guarantee of data quality or distills from black-box commercial models (e.g., GPT-4V / Gemini) causing the performance upper bounded by that model. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that includes a self-augment step and a specialist-augment step to iteratively improve data quality and model performance. In the self-augment step, a VLM recaptions its own pretraining data to enhance data quality, and then retrains from scratch using this refined dataset to improve model performance. This process can iterate for several rounds. Once self-augmentation saturates, we employ several specialist VLMs finetuned from the self-augmented VLM with domain-specific expertise, to further infuse specialist knowledge into the generalist VLM through task-oriented recaptioning and retraining. With the combined self-augmented and specialist-augmented training, we introduce VILA^2 (VILA-augmented-VILA), a VLM family that consistently improves the accuracy on a wide range of tasks over prior art, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on MMMU leaderboard among open-sourced models.

Title: DDK: Distilling Domain Knowledge for Efficient Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16154
Summary: Despite the advanced intelligence abilities of large language models (LLMs) in various applications, they still face significant computational and storage demands. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective strategy to improve the performance of a smaller LLM (i.e., the student model) by transferring knowledge from a high-performing LLM (i.e., the teacher model). Prevailing techniques in LLM distillation typically use a black-box model API to generate high-quality pretrained and aligned datasets, or utilize white-box distillation by altering the loss function to better transfer knowledge from the teacher LLM. However, these methods ignore the knowledge differences between the student and teacher LLMs across domains. This results in excessive focus on domains with minimal performance gaps and insufficient attention to domains with large gaps, reducing overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a new LLM distillation framework called DDK, which dynamically adjusts the composition of the distillation dataset in a smooth manner according to the domain performance differences between the teacher and student models, making the distillation process more stable and effective. Extensive evaluations show that DDK significantly improves the performance of student models, outperforming both continuously pretrained baselines and existing knowledge distillation methods by a large margin.

Title: ViPer: Visual Personalization of Generative Models via Individual Preference Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17365
Summary: Different users find different images generated for the same prompt desirable. This gives rise to personalized image generation which involves creating images aligned with an individual's visual preference. Current generative models are, however, unpersonalized, as they are tuned to produce outputs that appeal to a broad audience. Using them to generate images aligned with individual users relies on iterative manual prompt engineering by the user which is inefficient and undesirable. We propose to personalize the image generation process by first capturing the generic preferences of the user in a one-time process by inviting them to comment on a small selection of images, explaining why they like or dislike each. Based on these comments, we infer a user's structured liked and disliked visual attributes, i.e., their visual preference, using a large language model. These attributes are used to guide a text-to-image model toward producing images that are tuned towards the individual user's visual preference. Through a series of user studies and large language model guided evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method results in generations that are well aligned with individual users' visual preferences.

Title: Scalify: scale propagation for efficient low-precision LLM training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17353
Summary: Low-precision formats such as float8 have been introduced in machine learning accelerated hardware to improve computational efficiency for large language models training and inference. Nevertheless, adoption by the ML community has been slowed down by the complex, and sometimes brittle, techniques required to match higher precision training accuracy. In this work, we present Scalify, a end-to-end scale propagation paradigm for computational graphs, generalizing and formalizing existing tensor scaling methods. Experiment results show that Scalify supports out-of-the-box float8 matrix multiplication and gradients representation, as well as float16 optimizer state storage. Our JAX implementation of Scalify is open-sourced at https://github.com/graphcore-research/jax-scalify

Title: OpenDevin: An Open Platform for AI Software Developers as Generalist Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16741
Summary: Software is one of the most powerful tools that we humans have at our disposal; it allows a skilled programmer to interact with the world in complex and profound ways. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce OpenDevin, a platform for the development of powerful and flexible AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a human developer: by writing code, interacting with a command line, and browsing the web. We describe how the platform allows for the implementation of new agents, safe interaction with sandboxed environments for code execution, coordination between multiple agents, and incorporation of evaluation benchmarks. Based on our currently incorporated benchmarks, we perform an evaluation of agents over 15 challenging tasks, including software engineering (e.g., SWE-Bench) and web browsing (e.g., WebArena), among others. Released under the permissive MIT license, OpenDevin is a community project spanning academia and industry with more than 1.3K contributions from over 160 contributors and will improve going forward.

Title: SV4D: Dynamic 3D Content Generation with Multi-Frame and Multi-View Consistency
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.17470
Summary: We present Stable Video 4D (SV4D), a latent video diffusion model for multi-frame and multi-view consistent dynamic 3D content generation. Unlike previous methods that rely on separately trained generative models for video generation and novel view synthesis, we design a unified diffusion model to generate novel view videos of dynamic 3D objects. Specifically, given a monocular reference video, SV4D generates novel views for each video frame that are temporally consistent. We then use the generated novel view videos to optimize an implicit 4D representation (dynamic NeRF) efficiently, without the need for cumbersome SDS-based optimization used in most prior works. To train our unified novel view video generation model, we curated a dynamic 3D object dataset from the existing Objaverse dataset. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets and user studies demonstrate SV4D's state-of-the-art performance on novel-view video synthesis as well as 4D generation compared to prior works.

Title: PrimeGuard: Safe and Helpful LLMs through Tuning-Free Routing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16318
Summary: Deploying language models (LMs) necessitates outputs to be both high-quality and compliant with safety guidelines. Although Inference-Time Guardrails (ITG) offer solutions that shift model output distributions towards compliance, we find that current methods struggle in balancing safety with helpfulness. ITG Methods that safely address non-compliant queries exhibit lower helpfulness while those that prioritize helpfulness compromise on safety. We refer to this trade-off as the guardrail tax, analogous to the alignment tax. To address this, we propose PrimeGuard, a novel ITG method that utilizes structured control flow.   PrimeGuard routes requests to different self-instantiations of the LM with varying instructions, leveraging its inherent instruction-following capabilities and in-context learning. Our tuning-free approach dynamically compiles system-designer guidelines for each query. We construct and release safe-eval, a diverse red-team safety benchmark. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrimeGuard, without fine-tuning, overcomes the guardrail tax by (1) significantly increasing resistance to iterative jailbreak attacks and (2) achieving state-of-the-art results in safety guardrailing while (3) matching helpfulness scores of alignment-tuned models. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PrimeGuard, without fine-tuning, outperforms all competing baselines and overcomes the guardrail tax by improving the fraction of safe responses from 61% to 97% and increasing average helpfulness scores from 4.17 to 4.29 on the largest models, while reducing attack success rate from 100% to 8%.   PrimeGuard implementation is available at https://github.com/dynamofl/PrimeGuard and safe-eval dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/dynamoai/safe_eval.

Title: SIGMA: Sinkhorn-Guided Masked Video Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15447
Summary: Video-based pretraining offers immense potential for learning strong visual representations on an unprecedented scale. Recently, masked video modeling methods have shown promising scalability, yet fall short in capturing higher-level semantics due to reconstructing predefined low-level targets such as pixels. To tackle this, we present Sinkhorn-guided Masked Video Modelling (SIGMA), a novel video pretraining method that jointly learns the video model in addition to a target feature space using a projection network. However, this simple modification means that the regular L2 reconstruction loss will lead to trivial solutions as both networks are jointly optimized. As a solution, we distribute features of space-time tubes evenly across a limited number of learnable clusters. By posing this as an optimal transport problem, we enforce high entropy in the generated features across the batch, infusing semantic and temporal meaning into the feature space. The resulting cluster assignments are used as targets for a symmetric prediction task where the video model predicts cluster assignment of the projection network and vice versa. Experimental results on ten datasets across three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of SIGMA in learning more performant, temporally-aware, and robust video representations improving upon state-of-the-art methods.

Title: A Simulation Benchmark for Autonomous Racing with Large-Scale Human Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16680
Summary: Despite the availability of international prize-money competitions, scaled vehicles, and simulation environments, research on autonomous racing and the control of sports cars operating close to the limit of handling has been limited by the high costs of vehicle acquisition and management, as well as the limited physics accuracy of open-source simulators. In this paper, we propose a racing simulation platform based on the simulator Assetto Corsa to test, validate, and benchmark autonomous driving algorithms, including reinforcement learning (RL) and classical Model Predictive Control (MPC), in realistic and challenging scenarios. Our contributions include the development of this simulation platform, several state-of-the-art algorithms tailored to the racing environment, and a comprehensive dataset collected from human drivers. Additionally, we evaluate algorithms in the offline RL setting. All the necessary code (including environment and benchmarks), working examples, datasets, and videos are publicly released and can be found at: https://assetto-corsa-gym.github.io.

Title: KAN or MLP: A Fairer Comparison
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16674
Summary: This paper does not introduce a novel method. Instead, it offers a fairer and more comprehensive comparison of KAN and MLP models across various tasks, including machine learning, computer vision, audio processing, natural language processing, and symbolic formula representation. Specifically, we control the number of parameters and FLOPs to compare the performance of KAN and MLP. Our main observation is that, except for symbolic formula representation tasks, MLP generally outperforms KAN. We also conduct ablation studies on KAN and find that its advantage in symbolic formula representation mainly stems from its B-spline activation function. When B-spline is applied to MLP, performance in symbolic formula representation significantly improves, surpassing or matching that of KAN. However, in other tasks where MLP already excels over KAN, B-spline does not substantially enhance MLP's performance. Furthermore, we find that KAN's forgetting issue is more severe than that of MLP in a standard class-incremental continual learning setting, which differs from the findings reported in the KAN paper. We hope these results provide insights for future research on KAN and other MLP alternatives. Project link: https://github.com/yu-rp/KANbeFair

Title: Cross Anything: General Quadruped Robot Navigation through Complex Terrains
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16412
Summary: The application of vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved impressive success in various robotics tasks, but there are few explorations for foundation models used in quadruped robot navigation. We introduce Cross Anything System (CAS), an innovative system composed of a high-level reasoning module and a low-level control policy, enabling the robot to navigate across complex 3D terrains and reach the goal position. For high-level reasoning and motion planning, we propose a novel algorithmic system taking advantage of a VLM, with a design of task decomposition and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. For low-level locomotion control, we utilize the Probability Annealing Selection (PAS) method to train a control policy by reinforcement learning. Numerous experiments show that our whole system can accurately and robustly navigate across complex 3D terrains, and its strong generalization ability ensures the applications in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios and terrains.

Title: T2V-CompBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Compositional Text-to-video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14505
Summary: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have advanced significantly, yet their ability to compose different objects, attributes, actions, and motions into a video remains unexplored. Previous text-to-video benchmarks also neglect this important ability for evaluation. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on compositional text-to-video generation. We propose T2V-CompBench, the first benchmark tailored for compositional text-to-video generation. T2V-CompBench encompasses diverse aspects of compositionality, including consistent attribute binding, dynamic attribute binding, spatial relationships, motion binding, action binding, object interactions, and generative numeracy. We further carefully design evaluation metrics of MLLM-based metrics, detection-based metrics, and tracking-based metrics, which can better reflect the compositional text-to-video generation quality of seven proposed categories with 700 text prompts. The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified by correlation with human evaluations. We also benchmark various text-to-video generative models and conduct in-depth analysis across different models and different compositional categories. We find that compositional text-to-video generation is highly challenging for current models, and we hope that our attempt will shed light on future research in this direction.

Title: OutfitAnyone: Ultra-high Quality Virtual Try-On for Any Clothing and Any Person
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16224
Summary: Virtual Try-On (VTON) has become a transformative technology, empowering users to experiment with fashion without ever having to physically try on clothing. However, existing methods often struggle with generating high-fidelity and detail-consistent results. While diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion series, have shown their capability in creating high-quality and photorealistic images, they encounter formidable challenges in conditional generation scenarios like VTON. Specifically, these models struggle to maintain a balance between control and consistency when generating images for virtual clothing trials. OutfitAnyone addresses these limitations by leveraging a two-stream conditional diffusion model, enabling it to adeptly handle garment deformation for more lifelike results. It distinguishes itself with scalability-modulating factors such as pose, body shape and broad applicability, extending from anime to in-the-wild images. OutfitAnyone's performance in diverse scenarios underscores its utility and readiness for real-world deployment.

Title: INF-LLaVA: Dual-perspective Perception for High-Resolution Multimodal Large Language Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16198
Summary: With advancements in data availability and computing resources, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have showcased capabilities across various fields. However, the quadratic complexity of the vision encoder in MLLMs constrains the resolution of input images. Most current approaches mitigate this issue by cropping high-resolution images into smaller sub-images, which are then processed independently by the vision encoder. Despite capturing sufficient local details, these sub-images lack global context and fail to interact with one another. To address this limitation, we propose a novel MLLM, INF-LLaVA, designed for effective high-resolution image perception. INF-LLaVA incorporates two innovative components. First, we introduce a Dual-perspective Cropping Module (DCM), which ensures that each sub-image contains continuous details from a local perspective and comprehensive information from a global perspective. Second, we introduce Dual-perspective Enhancement Module (DEM) to enable the mutual enhancement of global and local features, allowing INF-LLaVA to effectively process high-resolution images by simultaneously capturing detailed local information and comprehensive global context. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of these components, and experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that INF-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLMs. Code and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/WeihuangLin/INF-LLaVA.

Title: F-HOI: Toward Fine-grained Semantic-Aligned 3D Human-Object Interactions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12435
Summary: Existing 3D human object interaction (HOI) datasets and models simply align global descriptions with the long HOI sequence, while lacking a detailed understanding of intermediate states and the transitions between states. In this paper, we argue that fine-grained semantic alignment, which utilizes state-level descriptions, offers a promising paradigm for learning semantically rich HOI representations. To achieve this, we introduce Semantic-HOI, a new dataset comprising over 20K paired HOI states with fine-grained descriptions for each HOI state and the body movements that happen between two consecutive states. Leveraging the proposed dataset, we design three state-level HOI tasks to accomplish fine-grained semantic alignment within the HOI sequence. Additionally, we propose a unified model called F-HOI, designed to leverage multimodal instructions and empower the Multi-modal Large Language Model to efficiently handle diverse HOI tasks. F-HOI offers multiple advantages: (1) It employs a unified task formulation that supports the use of versatile multimodal inputs. (2) It maintains consistency in HOI across 2D, 3D, and linguistic spaces. (3) It utilizes fine-grained textual supervision for direct optimization, avoiding intricate modeling of HOI states. Extensive experiments reveal that F-HOI effectively aligns HOI states with fine-grained semantic descriptions, adeptly tackling understanding, reasoning, generation, and reconstruction tasks.

Title: MovieDreamer: Hierarchical Generation for Coherent Long Visual Sequence
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16655
Summary: Recent advancements in video generation have primarily leveraged diffusion models for short-duration content. However, these approaches often fall short in modeling complex narratives and maintaining character consistency over extended periods, which is essential for long-form video production like movies. We propose MovieDreamer, a novel hierarchical framework that integrates the strengths of autoregressive models with diffusion-based rendering to pioneer long-duration video generation with intricate plot progressions and high visual fidelity. Our approach utilizes autoregressive models for global narrative coherence, predicting sequences of visual tokens that are subsequently transformed into high-quality video frames through diffusion rendering. This method is akin to traditional movie production processes, where complex stories are factorized down into manageable scene capturing. Further, we employ a multimodal script that enriches scene descriptions with detailed character information and visual style, enhancing continuity and character identity across scenes. We present extensive experiments across various movie genres, demonstrating that our approach not only achieves superior visual and narrative quality but also effectively extends the duration of generated content significantly beyond current capabilities.

Title: CoD, Towards an Interpretable Medical Agent using Chain of Diagnosis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13301
Summary: The field of medical diagnosis has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of large language models (LLMs), yet the challenges of interpretability within these models remain largely unaddressed. This study introduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of LLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a diagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a transparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence distribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability makes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms for inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we developed DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic benchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring controllability in diagnostic rigor.

Title: Compact Language Models via Pruning and Knowledge Distillation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14679
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) targeting different deployment scales and sizes are currently produced by training each variant from scratch; this is extremely compute-intensive. In this paper, we investigate if pruning an existing LLM and then re-training it with a fraction (<3%) of the original training data can be a suitable alternative to repeated, full retraining. To this end, we develop a set of practical and effective compression best practices for LLMs that combine depth, width, attention and MLP pruning with knowledge distillation-based retraining; we arrive at these best practices through a detailed empirical exploration of pruning strategies for each axis, methods to combine axes, distillation strategies, and search techniques for arriving at optimal compressed architectures. We use this guide to compress the Nemotron-4 family of LLMs by a factor of 2-4x, and compare their performance to similarly-sized models on a variety of language modeling tasks. Deriving 8B and 4B models from an already pretrained 15B model using our approach requires up to 40x fewer training tokens per model compared to training from scratch; this results in compute cost savings of 1.8x for training the full model family (15B, 8B, and 4B). Minitron models exhibit up to a 16% improvement in MMLU scores compared to training from scratch, perform comparably to other community models such as Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, and outperform state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature. We have open-sourced Minitron model weights on Huggingface, with corresponding supplementary material including example code available on GitHub.

Title: Visual Haystacks: Answering Harder Questions About Sets of Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13766
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made significant progress in the field of single-image visual question answering. However, these models face substantial challenges when tasked with queries that span extensive collections of images, similar to real-world scenarios like searching through large photo albums, finding specific information across the internet, or monitoring environmental changes through satellite imagery. This paper explores the task of Multi-Image Visual Question Answering (MIQA): given a large set of images and a natural language query, the task is to generate a relevant and grounded response. We propose a new public benchmark, dubbed "Visual Haystacks (VHs)," specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' capabilities in visual retrieval and reasoning over sets of unrelated images, where we perform comprehensive evaluations demonstrating that even robust closed-source models struggle significantly. Towards addressing these shortcomings, we introduce MIRAGE (Multi-Image Retrieval Augmented Generation), a novel retrieval/QA framework tailored for LMMs that confronts the challenges of MIQA with marked efficiency and accuracy improvements over baseline methods. Our evaluation shows that MIRAGE surpasses closed-source GPT-4o models by up to 11% on the VHs benchmark and offers up to 3.4x improvements in efficiency over text-focused multi-stage approaches.

Title: CGB-DM: Content and Graphic Balance Layout Generation with Transformer-based Diffusion Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15233
Summary: Layout generation is the foundation task of intelligent design, which requires the integration of visual aesthetics and harmonious expression of content delivery. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating precise and visually appealing layouts, including blocking, overlap, or spatial misalignment between layouts, which are closely related to the spatial structure of graphic layouts. We find that these methods overly focus on content information and lack constraints on layout spatial structure, resulting in an imbalance of learning content-aware and graphic-aware features. To tackle this issue, we propose Content and Graphic Balance Layout Generation with Transformer-based Diffusion Model (CGB-DM). Specifically, we first design a regulator that balances the predicted content and graphic weight, overcoming the tendency of paying more attention to the content on canvas. Secondly, we introduce a graphic constraint of saliency bounding box to further enhance the alignment of geometric features between layout representations and images. In addition, we adapt a transformer-based diffusion model as the backbone, whose powerful generation capability ensures the quality in layout generation. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our model framework can also be expanded to other graphic design fields.

Title: Discrete Flow Matching
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15595
Summary: Despite Flow Matching and diffusion models having emerged as powerful generative paradigms for continuous variables such as images and videos, their application to high-dimensional discrete data, such as language, is still limited. In this work, we present Discrete Flow Matching, a novel discrete flow paradigm designed specifically for generating discrete data. Discrete Flow Matching offers several key contributions: (i) it works with a general family of probability paths interpolating between source and target distributions; (ii) it allows for a generic formula for sampling from these probability paths using learned posteriors such as the probability denoiser (x-prediction) and noise-prediction (epsilon-prediction); (iii) practically, focusing on specific probability paths defined with different schedulers considerably improves generative perplexity compared to previous discrete diffusion and flow models; and (iv) by scaling Discrete Flow Matching models up to 1.7B parameters, we reach 6.7% Pass@1 and 13.4% Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7% Pass@1 and 20.6% Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding benchmarks. Our approach is capable of generating high-quality discrete data in a non-autoregressive fashion, significantly closing the gap between autoregressive models and discrete flow models.

Title: Consent in Crisis: The Rapid Decline of the AI Data Commons
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14933
Summary: General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems are built on massive swathes of public web data, assembled into corpora such as C4, RefinedWeb, and Dolma. To our knowledge, we conduct the first, large-scale, longitudinal audit of the consent protocols for the web domains underlying AI training corpora. Our audit of 14,000 web domains provides an expansive view of crawlable web data and how consent preferences to use it are changing over time. We observe a proliferation of AI-specific clauses to limit use, acute differences in restrictions on AI developers, as well as general inconsistencies between websites' expressed intentions in their Terms of Service and their robots.txt. We diagnose these as symptoms of ineffective web protocols, not designed to cope with the widespread re-purposing of the internet for AI. Our longitudinal analyses show that in a single year (2023-2024) there has been a rapid crescendo of data restrictions from web sources, rendering ~5%+ of all tokens in C4, or 28%+ of the most actively maintained, critical sources in C4, fully restricted from use. For Terms of Service crawling restrictions, a full 45% of C4 is now restricted. If respected or enforced, these restrictions are rapidly biasing the diversity, freshness, and scaling laws for general-purpose AI systems. We hope to illustrate the emerging crisis in data consent, foreclosing much of the open web, not only for commercial AI, but non-commercial AI and academic purposes.

Title: MIBench: Evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models over Multiple Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15272
Summary: Built on the power of LLMs, numerous multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance on various vision-language tasks across multiple benchmarks. However, most existing MLLMs and benchmarks primarily focus on single-image input scenarios, leaving the performance of MLLMs when handling realistic multiple images remain underexplored. Although a few benchmarks consider multiple images, their evaluation dimensions and samples are very limited. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new benchmark MIBench, to comprehensively evaluate fine-grained abilities of MLLMs in multi-image scenarios. Specifically, MIBench categorizes the multi-image abilities into three scenarios: multi-image instruction (MII), multimodal knowledge-seeking (MKS) and multimodal in-context learning (MIC), and constructs 13 tasks with a total of 13K annotated samples. During data construction, for MII and MKS, we extract correct options from manual annotations and create challenging distractors to obtain multiple-choice questions. For MIC, to enable an in-depth evaluation, we set four sub-tasks and transform the original datasets into in-context learning formats. We evaluate several open-source MLLMs and close-source MLLMs on the proposed MIBench. The results reveal that although current models excel in single-image tasks, they exhibit significant shortcomings when faced with multi-image inputs, such as confused fine-grained perception, limited multi-image reasoning, and unstable in-context learning. The annotated data in MIBench is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/StarBottle/MIBench.

Title: BOND: Aligning LLMs with Best-of-N Distillation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14622
Summary: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key driver of quality and safety in state-of-the-art large language models. Yet, a surprisingly simple and strong inference-time strategy is Best-of-N sampling that selects the best generation among N candidates. In this paper, we propose Best-of-N Distillation (BOND), a novel RLHF algorithm that seeks to emulate Best-of-N but without its significant computational overhead at inference time. Specifically, BOND is a distribution matching algorithm that forces the distribution of generations from the policy to get closer to the Best-of-N distribution. We use the Jeffreys divergence (a linear combination of forward and backward KL) to balance between mode-covering and mode-seeking behavior, and derive an iterative formulation that utilizes a moving anchor for efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and several design choices through experiments on abstractive summarization and Gemma models. Aligning Gemma policies with BOND outperforms other RLHF algorithms by improving results on several benchmarks.

Title: AssistantBench: Can Web Agents Solve Realistic and Time-Consuming Tasks?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15711
Summary: Language agents, built on top of language models (LMs), are systems that can interact with complex environments, such as the open web. In this work, we examine whether such agents can perform realistic and time-consuming tasks on the web, e.g., monitoring real-estate markets or locating relevant nearby businesses. We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consisting of 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering different scenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations of current systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented language models, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 25 points. While closed-book LMs perform well, they exhibit low precision since they tend to hallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero. Additionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantly outperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book models reaches the best overall performance. Moreover, we analyze failures of current systems and highlight that web navigation remains a major challenge.

Title: BoostMVSNeRFs: Boosting MVS-based NeRFs to Generalizable View Synthesis in Large-scale Scenes
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15848
Summary: While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated exceptional quality, their protracted training duration remains a limitation. Generalizable and MVS-based NeRFs, although capable of mitigating training time, often incur tradeoffs in quality. This paper presents a novel approach called BoostMVSNeRFs to enhance the rendering quality of MVS-based NeRFs in large-scale scenes. We first identify limitations in MVS-based NeRF methods, such as restricted viewport coverage and artifacts due to limited input views. Then, we address these limitations by proposing a new method that selects and combines multiple cost volumes during volume rendering. Our method does not require training and can adapt to any MVS-based NeRF methods in a feed-forward fashion to improve rendering quality. Furthermore, our approach is also end-to-end trainable, allowing fine-tuning on specific scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on large-scale datasets, showing significant rendering quality improvements in large-scale scenes and unbounded outdoor scenarios. We release the source code of BoostMVSNeRFs at https://su-terry.github.io/BoostMVSNeRFs/.

Title: POGEMA: A Benchmark Platform for Cooperative Multi-Agent Navigation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14931
Summary: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently excelled in solving challenging cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments with, mostly, few agents and full observability. Moreover, a range of crucial robotics-related tasks, such as multi-robot navigation and obstacle avoidance, that have been conventionally approached with the classical non-learnable methods (e.g., heuristic search) is currently suggested to be solved by the learning-based or hybrid methods. Still, in this domain, it is hard, not to say impossible, to conduct a fair comparison between classical, learning-based, and hybrid approaches due to the lack of a unified framework that supports both learning and evaluation. To this end, we introduce POGEMA, a set of comprehensive tools that includes a fast environment for learning, a generator of problem instances, the collection of pre-defined ones, a visualization toolkit, and a benchmarking tool that allows automated evaluation. We introduce and specify an evaluation protocol defining a range of domain-related metrics computed on the basics of the primary evaluation indicators (such as success rate and path length), allowing a fair multi-fold comparison. The results of such a comparison, which involves a variety of state-of-the-art MARL, search-based, and hybrid methods, are presented.

Title: Knowledge Mechanisms in Large Language Models: A Survey and Perspective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15017
Summary: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.

Title: LongVideoBench: A Benchmark for Long-context Interleaved Video-Language Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15754
Summary: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are processing increasingly longer and richer inputs. Albeit the progress, few public benchmark is available to measure such development. To mitigate this gap, we introduce LongVideoBench, a question-answering benchmark that features video-language interleaved inputs up to an hour long. Our benchmark includes 3,763 varying-length web-collected videos with their subtitles across diverse themes, designed to comprehensively evaluate LMMs on long-term multimodal understanding. To achieve this, we interpret the primary challenge as to accurately retrieve and reason over detailed multimodal information from long inputs. As such, we formulate a novel video question-answering task termed referring reasoning. Specifically, as part of the question, it contains a referring query that references related video contexts, called referred context. The model is then required to reason over relevant video details from the referred context. Following the paradigm of referring reasoning, we curate 6,678 human-annotated multiple-choice questions in 17 fine-grained categories, establishing one of the most comprehensive benchmarks for long-form video understanding. Evaluations suggest that the LongVideoBench presents significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, GPT-4-Turbo), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. In addition, our results indicate that model performance on the benchmark improves only when they are capable of processing more frames, positioning LongVideoBench as a valuable benchmark for evaluating future-generation long-context LMMs.

Title: Artist: Aesthetically Controllable Text-Driven Stylization without Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15842
Summary: Diffusion models entangle content and style generation during the denoising process, leading to undesired content modification when directly applied to stylization tasks. Existing methods struggle to effectively control the diffusion model to meet the aesthetic-level requirements for stylization. In this paper, we introduce Artist, a training-free approach that aesthetically controls the content and style generation of a pretrained diffusion model for text-driven stylization. Our key insight is to disentangle the denoising of content and style into separate diffusion processes while sharing information between them. We propose simple yet effective content and style control methods that suppress style-irrelevant content generation, resulting in harmonious stylization results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method excels at achieving aesthetic-level stylization requirements, preserving intricate details in the content image and aligning well with the style prompt. Furthermore, we showcase the highly controllability of the stylization strength from various perspectives. Code will be released, project home page: https://DiffusionArtist.github.io

Title: Cinemo: Consistent and Controllable Image Animation with Motion Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15642
Summary: Diffusion models have achieved great progress in image animation due to powerful generative capabilities. However, maintaining spatio-temporal consistency with detailed information from the input static image over time (e.g., style, background, and object of the input static image) and ensuring smoothness in animated video narratives guided by textual prompts still remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce Cinemo, a novel image animation approach towards achieving better motion controllability, as well as stronger temporal consistency and smoothness. In general, we propose three effective strategies at the training and inference stages of Cinemo to accomplish our goal. At the training stage, Cinemo focuses on learning the distribution of motion residuals, rather than directly predicting subsequent via a motion diffusion model. Additionally, a structural similarity index-based strategy is proposed to enable Cinemo to have better controllability of motion intensity. At the inference stage, a noise refinement technique based on discrete cosine transformation is introduced to mitigate sudden motion changes. Such three strategies enable Cinemo to produce highly consistent, smooth, and motion-controllable results. Compared to previous methods, Cinemo offers simpler and more precise user controllability. Extensive experiments against several state-of-the-art methods, including both commercial tools and research approaches, across multiple metrics, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.
