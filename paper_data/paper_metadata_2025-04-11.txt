Title: Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted
  Rejection Sampling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05410
Summary: The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed 100,000 tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.

Title: Caption Anything in Video: Fine-grained Object-centric Captioning via
  Spatiotemporal Multimodal Prompting
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05541
Summary: We present CAT-V (Caption AnyThing in Video), a training-free framework for fine-grained object-centric video captioning that enables detailed descriptions of user-selected objects through time. CAT-V integrates three key components: a Segmenter based on SAMURAI for precise object segmentation across frames, a Temporal Analyzer powered by TRACE-Uni for accurate event boundary detection and temporal analysis, and a Captioner using InternVL-2.5 for generating detailed object-centric descriptions. Through spatiotemporal visual prompts and chain-of-thought reasoning, our framework generates detailed, temporally-aware descriptions of objects' attributes, actions, statuses, interactions, and environmental contexts without requiring additional training data. CAT-V supports flexible user interactions through various visual prompts (points, bounding boxes, and irregular regions) and maintains temporal sensitivity by tracking object states and interactions across different time segments. Our approach addresses limitations of existing video captioning methods, which either produce overly abstract descriptions or lack object-level precision, enabling fine-grained, object-specific descriptions while maintaining temporal coherence and spatial accuracy. The GitHub repository for this project is available at https://github.com/yunlong10/CAT-V

Title: Pretraining Language Models for Diachronic Linguistic Change Discovery
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05523
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition.   We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.   We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.

Title: Masked Scene Modeling: Narrowing the Gap Between Supervised and
  Self-Supervised Learning in 3D Scene Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06719
Summary: Self-supervised learning has transformed 2D computer vision by enabling models trained on large, unannotated datasets to provide versatile off-the-shelf features that perform similarly to models trained with labels. However, in 3D scene understanding, self-supervised methods are typically only used as a weight initialization step for task-specific fine-tuning, limiting their utility for general-purpose feature extraction. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to assess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our protocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to create rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities of the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and nearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised model that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf features are used in a linear probing setup. In particular, our model is trained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked Scene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in a bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models. Our experiments not only demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance to supervised models, but also surpasses existing self-supervised approaches by a large margin. The model and training code can be found at our Github repository (https://github.com/phermosilla/msm).

Title: A Unified Agentic Framework for Evaluating Conditional Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07046
Summary: Conditional image generation has gained significant attention for its ability to personalize content. However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEval, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks. CIGEval utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) as its core, integrating a multi-functional toolbox and establishing a fine-grained evaluation framework. Additionally, we synthesize evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning, empowering smaller LMMs to autonomously select appropriate tools and conduct nuanced analyses based on tool outputs. Experiments across seven prominent conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that CIGEval (GPT-4o version) achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human assessments, closely matching the inter-annotator correlation of 0.47. Moreover, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training trajectories, CIGEval surpasses the previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method. Case studies on GPT-4o image generation highlight CIGEval's capability in identifying subtle issues related to subject consistency and adherence to control guidance, indicating its great potential for automating evaluation of image generation tasks with human-level reliability.

Title: WildGS-SLAM: Monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM in Dynamic Environments
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03886
Summary: We present WildGS-SLAM, a robust and efficient monocular RGB SLAM system designed to handle dynamic environments by leveraging uncertainty-aware geometric mapping. Unlike traditional SLAM systems, which assume static scenes, our approach integrates depth and uncertainty information to enhance tracking, mapping, and rendering performance in the presence of moving objects. We introduce an uncertainty map, predicted by a shallow multi-layer perceptron and DINOv2 features, to guide dynamic object removal during both tracking and mapping. This uncertainty map enhances dense bundle adjustment and Gaussian map optimization, improving reconstruction accuracy. Our system is evaluated on multiple datasets and demonstrates artifact-free view synthesis. Results showcase WildGS-SLAM's superior performance in dynamic environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: RuOpinionNE-2024: Extraction of Opinion Tuples from Russian News Texts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06947
Summary: In this paper, we introduce the Dialogue Evaluation shared task on extraction of structured opinions from Russian news texts. The task of the contest is to extract opinion tuples for a given sentence; the tuples are composed of a sentiment holder, its target, an expression and sentiment from the holder to the target. In total, the task received more than 100 submissions. The participants experimented mainly with large language models in zero-shot, few-shot and fine-tuning formats. The best result on the test set was obtained with fine-tuning of a large language model. We also compared 30 prompts and 11 open source language models with 3-32 billion parameters in the 1-shot and 10-shot settings and found the best models and prompts.

Title: VideoChat-R1: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Perception via Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06958
Summary: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.

Title: Are We Done with Object-Centric Learning?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07092
Summary: Object-centric learning (OCL) seeks to learn representations that only encode an object, isolated from other objects or background cues in a scene. This approach underpins various aims, including out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, sample-efficient composition, and modeling of structured environments. Most research has focused on developing unsupervised mechanisms that separate objects into discrete slots in the representation space, evaluated using unsupervised object discovery. However, with recent sample-efficient segmentation models, we can separate objects in the pixel space and encode them independently. This achieves remarkable zero-shot performance on OOD object discovery benchmarks, is scalable to foundation models, and can handle a variable number of slots out-of-the-box. Hence, the goal of OCL methods to obtain object-centric representations has been largely achieved. Despite this progress, a key question remains: How does the ability to separate objects within a scene contribute to broader OCL objectives, such as OOD generalization? We address this by investigating the OOD generalization challenge caused by spurious background cues through the lens of OCL. We propose a novel, training-free probe called Object-Centric Classification with Applied Masks (OCCAM), demonstrating that segmentation-based encoding of individual objects significantly outperforms slot-based OCL methods. However, challenges in real-world applications remain. We provide the toolbox for the OCL community to use scalable object-centric representations, and focus on practical applications and fundamental questions, such as understanding object perception in human cognition. Our code is available https://github.com/AlexanderRubinstein/OCCAM{here}.

Title: Self-Steering Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07081
Summary: While test-time reasoning enables language models to tackle complex tasks, searching or planning in natural language can be slow, costly, and error-prone. But even when LMs struggle to emulate the precise reasoning steps needed to solve a problem, they often excel at describing its abstract structure--both how to verify solutions and how to search for them. This paper introduces DisCIPL, a method for "self-steering" LMs where a Planner model generates a task-specific inference program that is executed by a population of Follower models. Our approach equips LMs with the ability to write recursive search procedures that guide LM inference, enabling new forms of verifiable and efficient reasoning. When instantiated with a small Follower (e.g., Llama-3.2-1B), DisCIPL matches (and sometimes outperforms) much larger models, including GPT-4o and o1, on challenging constrained generation tasks. In decoupling planning from execution, our work opens up a design space of highly-parallelized Monte Carlo inference strategies that outperform standard best-of-N sampling, require no finetuning, and can be implemented automatically by existing LMs.

Title: RobustDexGrasp: Robust Dexterous Grasping of General Objects from
  Single-view Perception
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05287
Summary: Robust grasping of various objects from single-view perception is fundamental for dexterous robots. Previous works often rely on fully observable objects, expert demonstrations, or static grasping poses, which restrict their generalization ability and adaptability to external disturbances. In this paper, we present a reinforcement-learning-based framework that enables zero-shot dynamic dexterous grasping of a wide range of unseen objects from single-view perception, while performing adaptive motions to external disturbances. We utilize a hand-centric object representation for shape feature extraction that emphasizes interaction-relevant local shapes, enhancing robustness to shape variance and uncertainty. To enable effective hand adaptation to disturbances with limited observations, we propose a mixed curriculum learning strategy, which first utilizes imitation learning to distill a policy trained with privileged real-time visual-tactile feedback, and gradually transfers to reinforcement learning to learn adaptive motions under disturbances caused by observation noises and dynamic randomization. Our experiments demonstrate strong generalization in grasping unseen objects with random poses, achieving success rates of 97.0% across 247,786 simulated objects and 94.6% across 512 real objects. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method to various disturbances, including unobserved object movement and external forces, through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Title: OmniCaptioner: One Captioner to Rule Them All
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07089
Summary: We propose OmniCaptioner, a versatile visual captioning framework for generating fine-grained textual descriptions across a wide variety of visual domains. Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.

Title: DiTaiListener: Controllable High Fidelity Listener Video Generation with
  Diffusion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04010
Summary: Generating naturalistic and nuanced listener motions for extended interactions remains an open problem. Existing methods often rely on low-dimensional motion codes for facial behavior generation followed by photorealistic rendering, limiting both visual fidelity and expressive richness. To address these challenges, we introduce DiTaiListener, powered by a video diffusion model with multimodal conditions. Our approach first generates short segments of listener responses conditioned on the speaker's speech and facial motions with DiTaiListener-Gen. It then refines the transitional frames via DiTaiListener-Edit for a seamless transition. Specifically, DiTaiListener-Gen adapts a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for the task of listener head portrait generation by introducing a Causal Temporal Multimodal Adapter (CTM-Adapter) to process speakers' auditory and visual cues. CTM-Adapter integrates speakers' input in a causal manner into the video generation process to ensure temporally coherent listener responses. For long-form video generation, we introduce DiTaiListener-Edit, a transition refinement video-to-video diffusion model. The model fuses video segments into smooth and continuous videos, ensuring temporal consistency in facial expressions and image quality when merging short video segments produced by DiTaiListener-Gen. Quantitatively, DiTaiListener achieves the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets in both photorealism (+73.8% in FID on RealTalk) and motion representation (+6.1% in FD metric on VICO) spaces. User studies confirm the superior performance of DiTaiListener, with the model being the clear preference in terms of feedback, diversity, and smoothness, outperforming competitors by a significant margin.

Title: A Sober Look at Progress in Language Model Reasoning: Pitfalls and Paths
  to Reproducibility
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07086
Summary: Reasoning has emerged as the next major frontier for language models (LMs), with rapid advances from both academic and industrial labs. However, this progress often outpaces methodological rigor, with many evaluations relying on benchmarking practices that lack transparency, robustness, or statistical grounding. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study and find that current mathematical reasoning benchmarks are highly sensitive to subtle implementation choices - including decoding parameters, random seeds, prompt formatting, and even hardware and software-framework configurations. Performance gains reported in recent studies frequently hinge on unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance. To address these issues, we propose a standardized evaluation framework with clearly defined best practices and reporting standards. Using this framework, we reassess recent methods and find that reinforcement learning (RL) approaches yield only modest improvements - far below prior claims - and are prone to overfitting, especially on small-scale benchmarks like AIME24. In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods show consistently stronger generalization. To foster reproducibility, we release all code, prompts, and model outputs, for reasoning benchmarks, establishing more rigorous foundations for future work.

Title: GenDoP: Auto-regressive Camera Trajectory Generation as a Director of
  Photography
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07083
Summary: Camera trajectory design plays a crucial role in video production, serving as a fundamental tool for conveying directorial intent and enhancing visual storytelling. In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Title: Missing Premise exacerbates Overthinking: Are Reasoning Models losing
  Critical Thinking Skill?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06514
Summary: We find that the response length of reasoning LLMs, whether trained by reinforcement learning or supervised learning, drastically increases for ill-posed questions with missing premises (MiP), ending up with redundant and ineffective thinking. This newly introduced scenario exacerbates the general overthinking issue to a large extent, which we name as the MiP-Overthinking. Such failures are against the ``test-time scaling law'' but have been widely observed on multiple datasets we curated with MiP, indicating the harm of cheap overthinking and a lack of critical thinking. Surprisingly, LLMs not specifically trained for reasoning exhibit much better performance on the MiP scenario, producing much shorter responses that quickly identify ill-posed queries. This implies a critical flaw of the current training recipe for reasoning LLMs, which does not encourage efficient thinking adequately, leading to the abuse of thinking patterns. To further investigate the reasons behind such failures, we conduct fine-grained analyses of the reasoning length, overthinking patterns, and location of critical thinking on different types of LLMs. Moreover, our extended ablation study reveals that the overthinking is contagious through the distillation of reasoning models' responses. These results improve the understanding of overthinking and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem.

Title: FantasyTalking: Realistic Talking Portrait Generation via Coherent
  Motion Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04842
Summary: Creating a realistic animatable avatar from a single static portrait remains challenging. Existing approaches often struggle to capture subtle facial expressions, the associated global body movements, and the dynamic background. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pretrained video diffusion transformer model to generate high-fidelity, coherent talking portraits with controllable motion dynamics. At the core of our work is a dual-stage audio-visual alignment strategy. In the first stage, we employ a clip-level training scheme to establish coherent global motion by aligning audio-driven dynamics across the entire scene, including the reference portrait, contextual objects, and background. In the second stage, we refine lip movements at the frame level using a lip-tracing mask, ensuring precise synchronization with audio signals. To preserve identity without compromising motion flexibility, we replace the commonly used reference network with a facial-focused cross-attention module that effectively maintains facial consistency throughout the video. Furthermore, we integrate a motion intensity modulation module that explicitly controls expression and body motion intensity, enabling controllable manipulation of portrait movements beyond mere lip motion. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed approach achieves higher quality with better realism, coherence, motion intensity, and identity preservation.

Title: OLMoTrace: Tracing Language Model Outputs Back to Trillions of Training
  Tokens
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07096
Summary: We present OLMoTrace, the first system that traces the outputs of language models back to their full, multi-trillion-token training data in real time. OLMoTrace finds and shows verbatim matches between segments of language model output and documents in the training text corpora. Powered by an extended version of infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), our system returns tracing results within a few seconds. OLMoTrace can help users understand the behavior of language models through the lens of their training data. We showcase how it can be used to explore fact checking, hallucination, and the creativity of language models. OLMoTrace is publicly available and fully open-source.

Title: DDT: Decoupled Diffusion Transformer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05741
Summary: Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable generation quality, albeit requiring longer training iterations and numerous inference steps. In each denoising step, diffusion transformers encode the noisy inputs to extract the lower-frequency semantic component and then decode the higher frequency with identical modules. This scheme creates an inherent optimization dilemma: encoding low-frequency semantics necessitates reducing high-frequency components, creating tension between semantic encoding and high-frequency decoding. To resolve this challenge, we propose a new \color{ddtD}ecoupled \color{ddtD}iffusion \color{ddtT}ransformer~(\color{ddtDDT}), with a decoupled design of a dedicated condition encoder for semantic extraction alongside a specialized velocity decoder. Our experiments reveal that a more substantial encoder yields performance improvements as model size increases. For ImageNet 256times256, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of {1.31 FID}~(nearly 4times faster training convergence compared to previous diffusion transformers). For ImageNet 512times512, Our DDT-XL/2 achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.28. Additionally, as a beneficial by-product, our decoupled architecture enhances inference speed by enabling the sharing self-condition between adjacent denoising steps. To minimize performance degradation, we propose a novel statistical dynamic programming approach to identify optimal sharing strategies.

Title: SkillWeaver: Web Agents can Self-Improve by Discovering and Honing
  Skills
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07079
Summary: To survive and thrive in complex environments, humans have evolved sophisticated self-improvement mechanisms through environment exploration, hierarchical abstraction of experiences into reuseable skills, and collaborative construction of an ever-growing skill repertoire. Despite recent advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining skills, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SkillWeaver, a skill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing the agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites demonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs, which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.

Title: Unified World Models: Coupling Video and Action Diffusion for
  Pretraining on Large Robotic Datasets
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02792
Summary: Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach towards building generalist robots. However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

Title: ProtoGCD: Unified and Unbiased Prototype Learning for Generalized
  Category Discovery
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03755
Summary: Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a pragmatic but underexplored problem, which requires models to automatically cluster and discover novel categories by leveraging the labeled samples from old classes. The challenge is that unlabeled data contain both old and new classes. Early works leveraging pseudo-labeling with parametric classifiers handle old and new classes separately, which brings about imbalanced accuracy between them. Recent methods employing contrastive learning neglect potential positives and are decoupled from the clustering objective, leading to biased representations and sub-optimal results. To address these issues, we introduce a unified and unbiased prototype learning framework, namely ProtoGCD, wherein old and new classes are modeled with joint prototypes and unified learning objectives, {enabling unified modeling between old and new classes}. Specifically, we propose a dual-level adaptive pseudo-labeling mechanism to mitigate confirmation bias, together with two regularization terms to collectively help learn more suitable representations for GCD. Moreover, for practical considerations, we devise a criterion to estimate the number of new classes. Furthermore, we extend ProtoGCD to detect unseen outliers, achieving task-level unification. Comprehensive experiments show that ProtoGCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both generic and fine-grained datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/mashijie1028/ProtoGCD.

Title: HybriMoE: Hybrid CPU-GPU Scheduling and Cache Management for Efficient
  MoE Inference
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05897
Summary: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has demonstrated significant advantages as it enables to increase the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. However, the large MoE model size still introduces substantial memory demands, which usually requires expert offloading on resource-constrained platforms and incurs significant overhead. Hybrid CPU-GPU inference has been proposed to leverage CPU computation to reduce expert loading overhead but faces major challenges: on one hand, the expert activation patterns of MoE models are highly unstable, rendering the fixed mapping strategies in existing works inefficient; on the other hand, the hybrid CPU-GPU schedule for MoE is inherently complex due to the diverse expert sizes, structures, uneven workload distribution, etc. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose HybriMoE, a hybrid CPU-GPU inference framework that improves resource utilization through a novel CPU-GPU scheduling and cache management system. HybriMoE introduces (i) a dynamic intra-layer scheduling strategy to balance workloads across CPU and GPU, (ii) an impact-driven inter-layer prefetching algorithm, and (iii) a score-based caching algorithm to mitigate expert activation instability. We implement HybriMoE on top of the kTransformers framework and evaluate it on three widely used MoE-based LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that HybriMoE achieves an average speedup of 1.33times in the prefill stage and 1.70times in the decode stage compared to state-of-the-art hybrid MoE inference framework. Our code is available at: https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/HybriMoE.

Title: Efficient Reinforcement Finetuning via Adaptive Curriculum Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05520
Summary: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces the number of training steps by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.

Title: Leanabell-Prover: Posttraining Scaling in Formal Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06122
Summary: Recent advances in automated theorem proving (ATP) through LLMs have highlighted the potential of formal reasoning with Lean 4 codes. However, ATP has not yet be revolutionized by the recent posttraining scaling as demonstrated by Open AI O1/O3 and Deepseek R1. In this work, we investigate the entire posttraining of ATP, aiming to align it with breakthroughs in reasoning models in natural languages.To begin, we continual train current ATP models with a hybrid dataset, which consists of numerous statement-proof pairs, and additional data aimed at incorporating cognitive behaviors that emulate human reasoning and hypothesis refinement. Next, we explore reinforcement learning with the use of outcome reward returned by Lean 4 compiler. Through our designed continual training and reinforcement learning processes, we have successfully improved existing formal provers, including both DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5 and Goedel-Prover, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of whole-proof generation. For example, we achieve a 59.8% pass rate (pass@32) on MiniF2F. This is an on-going project and we will progressively update our findings, release our data and training details.

Summary: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow models have drawn considerable attention recently due to their remarkable ability to deliver flexible visual creations. Still, high-resolution image synthesis presents formidable challenges due to the scarcity and complexity of high-resolution content. To this end, we present HiFlow, a training-free and model-agnostic framework to unlock the resolution potential of pre-trained flow models. Specifically, HiFlow establishes a virtual reference flow within the high-resolution space that effectively captures the characteristics of low-resolution flow information, offering guidance for high-resolution generation through three key aspects: initialization alignment for low-frequency consistency, direction alignment for structure preservation, and acceleration alignment for detail fidelity. By leveraging this flow-aligned guidance, HiFlow substantially elevates the quality of high-resolution image synthesis of T2I models and demonstrates versatility across their personalized variants. Extensive experiments validate HiFlow's superiority in achieving superior high-resolution image quality over current state-of-the-art methods.

Title: COIG-P: A High-Quality and Large-Scale Chinese Preference Dataset for
  Alignment with Human Values
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05535
Summary: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our codes and data are released in https://github.com/multimodal-art-projection/COIG-P.

Title: V-MAGE: A Game Evaluation Framework for Assessing Visual-Centric
  Capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06148
Summary: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have led to significant improvements across various multimodal benchmarks. However, as evaluations shift from static datasets to open-world, dynamic environments, current game-based benchmarks remain inadequate because they lack visual-centric tasks and fail to assess the diverse reasoning skills required for real-world decision-making. To address this, we introduce Visual-centric Multiple Abilities Game Evaluation (V-MAGE), a game-based evaluation framework designed to assess visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. V-MAGE features five diverse games with 30+ handcrafted levels, testing models on core visual skills such as positioning, trajectory tracking, timing, and visual memory, alongside higher-level reasoning like long-term planning and deliberation. We use V-MAGE to evaluate leading MLLMs, revealing significant challenges in their visual perception and reasoning. In all game environments, the top-performing MLLMs, as determined by Elo rating comparisons, exhibit a substantial performance gap compared to humans. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including various types of perceptual errors made by the models, and suggest potential avenues for improvement from an agent-centric perspective, such as refining agent strategies and addressing perceptual inaccuracies. Code is available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/V-MAGE.

Title: Accelerate Parallelizable Reasoning via Parallel Decoding within One
  Sequence
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20533
Summary: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated significant improvements in accuracy, particularly for complex tasks such as mathematical reasoning, by employing detailed and comprehensive reasoning processes. However, generating these lengthy reasoning sequences is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this inefficiency, we leverage the inherent parallelizability of certain tasks to accelerate the reasoning process. Specifically, when multiple parallel reasoning branches exist, we decode multiple tokens per step using a specialized attention mask, processing them within a single sequence, avoiding additional memory usage. Experimental results show that our method achieves over 100% speedup in decoding time while maintaining the answer quality.

Title: Skywork R1V: Pioneering Multimodal Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05599
Summary: We introduce Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model extending the an R1-series Large language models (LLM) to visual modalities via an efficient multimodal transfer method. Leveraging a lightweight visual projector, Skywork R1V facilitates seamless multimodal adaptation without necessitating retraining of either the foundational language model or the vision encoder. To strengthen visual-text alignment, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing excessive reasoning overthinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Skywork R1V, with only 38B parameters, delivers competitive performance, achieving a score of 69.0 on the MMMU benchmark and 67.5 on MathVista. Meanwhile, it maintains robust textual reasoning performance, evidenced by impressive scores of 72.0 on AIME and 94.0 on MATH500. The Skywork R1V model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility.

Title: Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06261
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

Title: Less-to-More Generalization: Unlocking More Controllability by
  In-Context Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02160
Summary: Although subject-driven generation has been extensively explored in image generation due to its wide applications, it still has challenges in data scalability and subject expansibility. For the first challenge, moving from curating single-subject datasets to multiple-subject ones and scaling them is particularly difficult. For the second, most recent methods center on single-subject generation, making it hard to apply when dealing with multi-subject scenarios. In this study, we propose a highly-consistent data synthesis pipeline to tackle this challenge. This pipeline harnesses the intrinsic in-context generation capabilities of diffusion transformers and generates high-consistency multi-subject paired data. Additionally, we introduce UNO, which consists of progressive cross-modal alignment and universal rotary position embedding. It is a multi-image conditioned subject-to-image model iteratively trained from a text-to-image model. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve high consistency while ensuring controllability in both single-subject and multi-subject driven generation.

Title: OmniSVG: A Unified Scalable Vector Graphics Generation Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06263
Summary: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an important image format widely adopted in graphic design because of their resolution independence and editability. The study of generating high-quality SVG has continuously drawn attention from both designers and researchers in the AIGC community. However, existing methods either produces unstructured outputs with huge computational cost or is limited to generating monochrome icons of over-simplified structures. To produce high-quality and complex SVG, we propose OmniSVG, a unified framework that leverages pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. By parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, OmniSVG decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while maintaining the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. To further advance the development of SVG synthesis, we introduce MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million richly annotated SVG assets, along with a standardized evaluation protocol for conditional SVG generation tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods and demonstrates its potential for integration into professional SVG design workflows.

Title: Generative Evaluation of Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02810
Summary: With powerful large language models (LLMs) demonstrating superhuman reasoning capabilities, a critical question arises: Do LLMs genuinely reason, or do they merely recall answers from their extensive, web-scraped training datasets? Publicly released benchmarks inevitably become contaminated once incorporated into subsequent LLM training sets, undermining their reliability as faithful assessments. To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities.

Title: Tuning-Free Image Editing with Fidelity and Editability via Unified
  Latent Diffusion Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05594
Summary: Balancing fidelity and editability is essential in text-based image editing (TIE), where failures commonly lead to over- or under-editing issues. Existing methods typically rely on attention injections for structure preservation and leverage the inherent text alignment capabilities of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models for editability, but they lack explicit and unified mechanisms to properly balance these two objectives. In this work, we introduce UnifyEdit, a tuning-free method that performs diffusion latent optimization to enable a balanced integration of fidelity and editability within a unified framework. Unlike direct attention injections, we develop two attention-based constraints: a self-attention (SA) preservation constraint for structural fidelity, and a cross-attention (CA) alignment constraint to enhance text alignment for improved editability. However, simultaneously applying both constraints can lead to gradient conflicts, where the dominance of one constraint results in over- or under-editing. To address this challenge, we introduce an adaptive time-step scheduler that dynamically adjusts the influence of these constraints, guiding the diffusion latent toward an optimal balance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its superiority in achieving a robust balance between structure preservation and text alignment across various editing tasks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be available at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UnifyEdit.

Title: CrossWordBench: Evaluating the Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs and LVLMs
  with Controllable Puzzle Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00043
Summary: Existing reasoning evaluation frameworks for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) predominantly either assess text-based reasoning or vision-language understanding capabilities, with limited dynamic interplay between textual and visual constraints. To address this limitation, we introduce CrossWordBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of both LLMs and LVLMs through the medium of crossword puzzles-a task requiring multimodal adherence to semantic constraints from text-based clues and intersectional constraints from visual grid structures. CrossWordBench leverages a controllable puzzle generation framework that produces puzzles in multiple formats (text and image) and offers different evaluation strategies ranging from direct puzzle solving to interactive modes. Our extensive evaluation of over 20 models reveals that reasoning LLMs outperform non-reasoning models substantially by effectively leveraging crossing-letter constraints. We further demonstrate that LVLMs struggle with the task, showing a strong correlation between their puzzle-solving performance and grid-parsing accuracy. Our findings offer insights into the limitations of the reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and LVLMs, and provide an effective approach for creating multimodal constrained tasks for future evaluations.

Title: An Empirical Study of GPT-4o Image Generation Capabilities
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05979
Summary: The landscape of image generation has rapidly evolved, from early GAN-based approaches to diffusion models and, most recently, to unified generative architectures that seek to bridge understanding and generation tasks. Recent advances, especially the GPT-4o, have demonstrated the feasibility of high-fidelity multimodal generation, their architectural design remains mysterious and unpublished. This prompts the question of whether image and text generation have already been successfully integrated into a unified framework for those methods. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of GPT-4o's image generation capabilities, benchmarking it against leading open-source and commercial models. Our evaluation covers four main categories, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image-to-3D, and image-to-X generation, with more than 20 tasks. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of GPT-4o under various settings, and situates it within the broader evolution of generative modeling. Through this investigation, we identify promising directions for future unified generative models, emphasizing the role of architectural design and data scaling.

Title: 3D Scene Understanding Through Local Random Access Sequence Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03875
Summary: 3D scene understanding from single images is a pivotal problem in computer vision with numerous downstream applications in graphics, augmented reality, and robotics. While diffusion-based modeling approaches have shown promise, they often struggle to maintain object and scene consistency, especially in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an autoregressive generative approach called Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) modeling, which uses local patch quantization and randomly ordered sequence generation. By utilizing optical flow as an intermediate representation for 3D scene editing, our experiments demonstrate that LRAS achieves state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and 3D object manipulation capabilities. Furthermore, we show that our framework naturally extends to self-supervised depth estimation through a simple modification of the sequence design. By achieving strong performance on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, LRAS provides a unified and effective framework for building the next generation of 3D vision models.

Title: Distillation and Refinement of Reasoning in Small Language Models for
  Document Re-ranking
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03947
Summary: We present a novel approach for training small language models for reasoning-intensive document ranking that combines knowledge distillation with reinforcement learning optimization. While existing methods often rely on expensive human annotations or large black-box language models, our methodology leverages web data and a teacher LLM to automatically generate high-quality training examples with relevance explanations. By framing document ranking as a reinforcement learning problem and incentivizing explicit reasoning capabilities, we train a compact 3B parameter language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark. Our model ranks third on the leaderboard while using substantially fewer parameters than other approaches, outperforming models that are over 20 times larger. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that generating explanations during inference, rather than directly predicting relevance scores, enables more effective reasoning with smaller language models. The self-supervised nature of our method offers a scalable and interpretable solution for modern information retrieval systems.

Title: Why Reasoning Matters? A Survey of Advancements in Multimodal Reasoning
  (v1)
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03151
Summary: Reasoning is central to human intelligence, enabling structured problem-solving across diverse tasks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their reasoning abilities in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic domains. However, effectively extending these capabilities into multimodal contexts-where models must integrate both visual and textual inputs-continues to be a significant challenge. Multimodal reasoning introduces complexities, such as handling conflicting information across modalities, which require models to adopt advanced interpretative strategies. Addressing these challenges involves not only sophisticated algorithms but also robust methodologies for evaluating reasoning accuracy and coherence. This paper offers a concise yet insightful overview of reasoning techniques in both textual and multimodal LLMs. Through a thorough and up-to-date comparison, we clearly formulate core reasoning challenges and opportunities, highlighting practical methods for post-training optimization and test-time inference. Our work provides valuable insights and guidance, bridging theoretical frameworks and practical implementations, and sets clear directions for future research.

Title: Sample, Don't Search: Rethinking Test-Time Alignment for Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03790
Summary: Increasing test-time computation has emerged as a promising direction for improving language model performance, particularly in scenarios where model finetuning is impractical or impossible due to computational constraints or private model weights. However, existing test-time search methods using a reward model (RM) often degrade in quality as compute scales, due to the over-optimization of what are inherently imperfect reward proxies. We introduce QAlign, a new test-time alignment approach. As we scale test-time compute, QAlign converges to sampling from the optimal aligned distribution for each individual prompt. By adopting recent advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo for text generation, our method enables better-aligned outputs without modifying the underlying model or even requiring logit access. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QAlign on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic) using a task-specific RM, showing consistent improvements over existing test-time compute methods like best-of-n and majority voting. Furthermore, when applied with more realistic RMs trained on the Tulu 3 preference dataset, QAlign outperforms direct preference optimization (DPO), best-of-n, majority voting, and weighted majority voting on a diverse range of datasets (GSM8K, MATH500, IFEval, MMLU-Redux, and TruthfulQA). A practical solution to aligning language models at test time using additional computation without degradation, our approach expands the limits of the capability that can be obtained from off-the-shelf language models without further training.

Title: Rethinking Reflection in Pre-Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04022
Summary: A language model's ability to reflect on its own reasoning provides a key advantage for solving complex problems. While most recent research has focused on how this ability develops during reinforcement learning, we show that it actually begins to emerge much earlier - during the model's pre-training. To study this, we introduce deliberate errors into chains-of-thought and test whether the model can still arrive at the correct answer by recognizing and correcting these mistakes. By tracking performance across different stages of pre-training, we observe that this self-correcting ability appears early and improves steadily over time. For instance, an OLMo2-7B model pre-trained on 4 trillion tokens displays self-correction on our six self-reflection tasks.

Title: Rethinking Multilingual Continual Pretraining: Data Mixing for Adapting
  LLMs Across Languages and Resources
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04152
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant disparities in performance across languages, primarily benefiting high-resource languages while marginalizing underrepresented ones. Continual Pretraining (CPT) has emerged as a promising approach to address this imbalance, although the relative effectiveness of monolingual, bilingual, and code-augmented data strategies remains unclear. This study systematically evaluates 36 CPT configurations involving three multilingual base models, across 30+ languages categorized as altruistic, selfish, and stagnant, spanning various resource levels. Our findings reveal three major insights: (1) Bilingual CPT improves multilingual classification but often causes language mixing issues during generation. (2) Including programming code data during CPT consistently enhances multilingual classification accuracy, particularly benefiting low-resource languages, but introduces a trade-off by slightly degrading generation quality. (3) Contrary to prior work, we observe substantial deviations from language classifications according to their impact on cross-lingual transfer: Languages classified as altruistic often negatively affect related languages, selfish languages show conditional and configuration-dependent behavior, and stagnant languages demonstrate surprising adaptability under certain CPT conditions. These nuanced interactions emphasize the complexity of multilingual representation learning, underscoring the importance of systematic studies on generalizable language classification to inform future multilingual CPT strategies.

Title: GlotEval: A Test Suite for Massively Multilingual Evaluation of Large
  Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04155
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are advancing at an unprecedented pace globally, with regions increasingly adopting these models for applications in their primary language. Evaluation of these models in diverse linguistic environments, especially in low-resource languages, has become a major challenge for academia and industry. Existing evaluation frameworks are disproportionately focused on English and a handful of high-resource languages, thereby overlooking the realistic performance of LLMs in multilingual and lower-resource scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce GlotEval, a lightweight framework designed for massively multilingual evaluation. Supporting seven key tasks (machine translation, text classification, summarization, open-ended generation, reading comprehension, sequence labeling, and intrinsic evaluation), spanning over dozens to hundreds of languages, GlotEval highlights consistent multilingual benchmarking, language-specific prompt templates, and non-English-centric machine translation. This enables a precise diagnosis of model strengths and weaknesses in diverse linguistic contexts. A multilingual translation case study demonstrates GlotEval's applicability for multilingual and language-specific evaluations.

Title: VAPO: Efficient and Reliable Reinforcement Learning for Advanced
  Reasoning Tasks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05118
Summary: We present VAPO, Value-based Augmented Proximal Policy Optimization framework for reasoning models., a novel framework tailored for reasoning models within the value-based paradigm. Benchmarked the AIME 2024 dataset, VAPO, built on the Qwen 32B pre-trained model, attains a state-of-the-art score of 60.4. In direct comparison under identical experimental settings, VAPO outperforms the previously reported results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B and DAPO by more than 10 points. The training process of VAPO stands out for its stability and efficiency. It reaches state-of-the-art performance within a mere 5,000 steps. Moreover, across multiple independent runs, no training crashes occur, underscoring its reliability. This research delves into long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning using a value-based reinforcement learning framework. We pinpoint three key challenges that plague value-based methods: value model bias, the presence of heterogeneous sequence lengths, and the sparsity of reward signals. Through systematic design, VAPO offers an integrated solution that effectively alleviates these challenges, enabling enhanced performance in long-CoT reasoning tasks.

Title: Mamba as a Bridge: Where Vision Foundation Models Meet Vision Language
  Models for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03193
Summary: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained traction in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) due to their strong generalization capabilities. However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/devinxzhang/MFuser.

Title: DiaTool-DPO: Multi-Turn Direct Preference Optimization for
  Tool-Augmented Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02882
Summary: Tool-Augmented Larage Language Models (TA-LLMs) have shown promise in real-world applications, but face challenges in handling incomplete queries and out-of-scope requests. While existing approaches rely mainly on Supervised Fine-Tuning with expert trajectories, we propose DiaTool-DPO, a novel method that enhances TA-LLM's dialogue capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization. We model TA-LLM interactions as a Markov Decision Process with 5 distinct dialogue states and categorize user queries into 3 types based on their state transition trajectories. We automatically construct paired trajectory datasets of correct and incorrect dialogue flows and introduce a specialized objective loss for dialogue control. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that DiaTool-DPO approaches GPT-4o's performance (94.8% in information gathering, 91% in tool call rejection) with substantial improvements over baseline (44% and 9.6% respectively) while maintaining core functionality. Our approach opens new possibilities for developing TA-LLMs that can handle diverse real-world scenarios without requiring additional expert demonstrations or human labeling.

Title: SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05299
Summary: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but require significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on mobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger models, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory usage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.   We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically engineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore architectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation optimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design choices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with minimal memory footprints.   Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during inference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an 18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals state-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend beyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.   Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive yet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly enhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient deployments at significantly smaller scales.

Title: T1: Tool-integrated Self-verification for Test-time Compute Scaling in
  Small Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04718
Summary: Recent studies have demonstrated that test-time compute scaling effectively improves the performance of small language models (sLMs). However, prior research has mainly examined test-time compute scaling with an additional larger model as a verifier, leaving self-verification by sLMs underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether sLMs can reliably self-verify their outputs under test-time scaling. We find that even with knowledge distillation from larger verifiers, sLMs struggle with verification tasks requiring memorization, such as numerical calculations and fact-checking. To address this limitation, we propose Tool-integrated self-verification (T1), which delegates memorization-heavy verification steps to external tools, such as a code interpreter. Our theoretical analysis shows that tool integration reduces memorization demands and improves test-time scaling performance. Experiments on the MATH benchmark demonstrate that, with T1, a Llama-3.2 1B model under test-time scaling outperforms the significantly larger Llama-3.1 8B model. Moreover, T1 generalizes effectively to both mathematical (MATH500) and multi-domain knowledge-intensive tasks (MMLU-Pro). Our findings highlight the potential of tool integration to substantially improve the self-verification abilities of sLMs.

Summary: We introduce Clinical ModernBERT, a transformer based encoder pretrained on large scale biomedical literature, clinical notes, and medical ontologies, incorporating PubMed abstracts, MIMIC IV clinical data, and medical codes with their textual descriptions. Building on ModernBERT the current state of the art natural language text encoder featuring architectural upgrades such as rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), Flash Attention, and extended context length up to 8,192 tokens our model adapts these innovations specifically for biomedical and clinical domains. Clinical ModernBERT excels at producing semantically rich representations tailored for long context tasks. We validate this both by analyzing its pretrained weights and through empirical evaluation on a comprehensive suite of clinical NLP benchmarks.
