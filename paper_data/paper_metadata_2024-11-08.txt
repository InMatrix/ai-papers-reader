Title: From Medprompt to o1: Exploration of Run-Time Strategies for Medical Challenge Problems and Beyond
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03590
Summary: Run-time steering strategies like Medprompt are valuable for guiding large language models (LLMs) to top performance on challenging tasks. Medprompt demonstrates that a general LLM can be focused to deliver state-of-the-art performance on specialized domains like medicine by using a prompt to elicit a run-time strategy involving chain of thought reasoning and ensembling. OpenAI's o1-preview model represents a new paradigm, where a model is designed to do run-time reasoning before generating final responses. We seek to understand the behavior of o1-preview on a diverse set of medical challenge problem benchmarks. Following on the Medprompt study with GPT-4, we systematically evaluate the o1-preview model across various medical benchmarks. Notably, even without prompting techniques, o1-preview largely outperforms the GPT-4 series with Medprompt. We further systematically study the efficacy of classic prompt engineering strategies, as represented by Medprompt, within the new paradigm of reasoning models. We found that few-shot prompting hinders o1's performance, suggesting that in-context learning may no longer be an effective steering approach for reasoning-native models. While ensembling remains viable, it is resource-intensive and requires careful cost-performance optimization. Our cost and accuracy analysis across run-time strategies reveals a Pareto frontier, with GPT-4o representing a more affordable option and o1-preview achieving state-of-the-art performance at higher cost. Although o1-preview offers top performance, GPT-4o with steering strategies like Medprompt retains value in specific contexts. Moreover, we note that the o1-preview model has reached near-saturation on many existing medical benchmarks, underscoring the need for new, challenging benchmarks. We close with reflections on general directions for inference-time computation with LLMs.

Title: Polynomial Composition Activations: Unleashing the Dynamics of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03884
Summary: Transformers have found extensive applications across various domains due to the powerful fitting capabilities. This success can be partially attributed to their inherent nonlinearity. Thus, in addition to the ReLU function employed in the original transformer architecture, researchers have explored alternative modules such as GeLU and SwishGLU to enhance nonlinearity and thereby augment representational capacity. In this paper, we propose a novel category of polynomial composition activations (PolyCom), designed to optimize the dynamics of transformers. Theoretically, we provide a comprehensive mathematical analysis of PolyCom, highlighting its enhanced expressivity and efficacy relative to other activation functions. Notably, we demonstrate that networks incorporating PolyCom achieve the optimal approximation rate, indicating that PolyCom networks require minimal parameters to approximate general smooth functions in Sobolev spaces. We conduct empirical experiments on the pre-training configurations of large language models (LLMs), including both dense and sparse architectures. By substituting conventional activation functions with PolyCom, we enable LLMs to capture higher-order interactions within the data, thus improving performance metrics in terms of accuracy and convergence rates. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements over other activation functions. Code is available at https://github.com/BryceZhuo/PolyCom.

Title: Self-Consistency Preference Optimization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04109
Summary: Self-alignment, whereby models learn to improve themselves without human annotation, is a rapidly growing research area. However, existing techniques often fail to improve complex reasoning tasks due to the difficulty of assigning correct rewards. An orthogonal approach that is known to improve correctness is self-consistency, a method applied at inference time based on multiple sampling in order to find the most consistent answer. In this work, we extend the self-consistency concept to help train models. We thus introduce self-consistency preference optimization (ScPO), which iteratively trains consistent answers to be preferred over inconsistent ones on unsupervised new problems. We show ScPO leads to large improvements over conventional reward model training on reasoning tasks such as GSM8K and MATH, closing the gap with supervised training with gold answers or preferences, and that combining ScPO with standard supervised learning improves results even further. On ZebraLogic, ScPO finetunes Llama-3 8B to be superior to Llama-3 70B, Gemma-2 27B, and Claude-3 Haiku.

Title: Large Language Models Orchestrating Structured Reasoning Achieve Kaggle Grandmaster Level
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03562
Summary: We introduce Agent K v1.0, an end-to-end autonomous data science agent designed to automate, optimise, and generalise across diverse data science tasks. Fully automated, Agent K v1.0 manages the entire data science life cycle by learning from experience. It leverages a highly flexible structured reasoning framework to enable it to dynamically process memory in a nested structure, effectively learning from accumulated experience stored to handle complex reasoning tasks. It optimises long- and short-term memory by selectively storing and retrieving key information, guiding future decisions based on environmental rewards. This iterative approach allows it to refine decisions without fine-tuning or backpropagation, achieving continuous improvement through experiential learning. We evaluate our agent's apabilities using Kaggle competitions as a case study. Following a fully automated protocol, Agent K v1.0 systematically addresses complex and multimodal data science tasks, employing Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. Our new evaluation framework rigorously assesses Agent K v1.0's end-to-end capabilities to generate and send submissions starting from a Kaggle competition URL. Results demonstrate that Agent K v1.0 achieves a 92.5\% success rate across tasks, spanning tabular, computer vision, NLP, and multimodal domains. When benchmarking against 5,856 human Kaggle competitors by calculating Elo-MMR scores for each, Agent K v1.0 ranks in the top 38\%, demonstrating an overall skill level comparable to Expert-level users. Notably, its Elo-MMR score falls between the first and third quartiles of scores achieved by human Grandmasters. Furthermore, our results indicate that Agent K v1.0 has reached a performance level equivalent to Kaggle Grandmaster, with a record of 6 gold, 3 silver, and 7 bronze medals, as defined by Kaggle's progression system.

Title: Both Text and Images Leaked! A Systematic Analysis of Multimodal LLM Data Contamination
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03823
Summary: The rapid progression of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated superior performance on various multimodal benchmarks. However, the issue of data contamination during training creates challenges in performance evaluation and comparison. While numerous methods exist for detecting dataset contamination in large language models (LLMs), they are less effective for MLLMs due to their various modalities and multiple training phases. In this study, we introduce a multimodal data contamination detection framework, MM-Detect, designed for MLLMs. Our experimental results indicate that MM-Detect is sensitive to varying degrees of contamination and can highlight significant performance improvements due to leakage of the training set of multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, We also explore the possibility of contamination originating from the pre-training phase of LLMs used by MLLMs and the fine-tuning phase of MLLMs, offering new insights into the stages at which contamination may be introduced.

Title: Adaptive Length Image Tokenization via Recurrent Allocation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02393
Summary: Current vision systems typically assign fixed-length representations to images, regardless of the information content. This contrasts with human intelligence - and even large language models - which allocate varying representational capacities based on entropy, context and familiarity. Inspired by this, we propose an approach to learn variable-length token representations for 2D images. Our encoder-decoder architecture recursively processes 2D image tokens, distilling them into 1D latent tokens over multiple iterations of recurrent rollouts. Each iteration refines the 2D tokens, updates the existing 1D latent tokens, and adaptively increases representational capacity by adding new tokens. This enables compression of images into a variable number of tokens, ranging from 32 to 256. We validate our tokenizer using reconstruction loss and FID metrics, demonstrating that token count aligns with image entropy, familiarity and downstream task requirements. Recurrent token processing with increasing representational capacity in each iteration shows signs of token specialization, revealing potential for object / part discovery.

Title: Inference Optimal VLMs Need Only One Visual Token but Larger Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03312
Summary: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various visual understanding and reasoning tasks. However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to substantial compute required to process the large number of input tokens (predominantly from the image) by the LLM. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input image-tokens, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent works around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is, as both the factors directly affect the VLM performance. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs, i.e., minimum downstream error at any given fixed inference compute, is achieved when using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., 5-10times), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take some initial steps towards building approaches tailored for high token compression settings. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/llava-token-compression.

Title: GarVerseLOD: High-Fidelity 3D Garment Reconstruction from a Single In-the-Wild Image using a Dataset with Levels of Details
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03047
Summary: Neural implicit functions have brought impressive advances to the state-of-the-art of clothed human digitization from multiple or even single images. However, despite the progress, current arts still have difficulty generalizing to unseen images with complex cloth deformation and body poses. In this work, we present GarVerseLOD, a new dataset and framework that paves the way to achieving unprecedented robustness in high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction from a single unconstrained image. Inspired by the recent success of large generative models, we believe that one key to addressing the generalization challenge lies in the quantity and quality of 3D garment data. Towards this end, GarVerseLOD collects 6,000 high-quality cloth models with fine-grained geometry details manually created by professional artists. In addition to the scale of training data, we observe that having disentangled granularities of geometry can play an important role in boosting the generalization capability and inference accuracy of the learned model. We hence craft GarVerseLOD as a hierarchical dataset with levels of details (LOD), spanning from detail-free stylized shape to pose-blended garment with pixel-aligned details. This allows us to make this highly under-constrained problem tractable by factorizing the inference into easier tasks, each narrowed down with smaller searching space. To ensure GarVerseLOD can generalize well to in-the-wild images, we propose a novel labeling paradigm based on conditional diffusion models to generate extensive paired images for each garment model with high photorealism. We evaluate our method on a massive amount of in-the-wild images. Experimental results demonstrate that GarVerseLOD can generate standalone garment pieces with significantly better quality than prior approaches. Project page: https://garverselod.github.io/

Title: Correlation of Object Detection Performance with Visual Saliency and Depth Estimation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02844
Summary: As object detection techniques continue to evolve, understanding their relationships with complementary visual tasks becomes crucial for optimising model architectures and computational resources. This paper investigates the correlations between object detection accuracy and two fundamental visual tasks: depth prediction and visual saliency prediction. Through comprehensive experiments using state-of-the-art models (DeepGaze IIE, Depth Anything, DPT-Large, and Itti's model) on COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, we find that visual saliency shows consistently stronger correlations with object detection accuracy (mArho up to 0.459 on Pascal VOC) compared to depth prediction (mArho up to 0.283). Our analysis reveals significant variations in these correlations across object categories, with larger objects showing correlation values up to three times higher than smaller objects. These findings suggest incorporating visual saliency features into object detection architectures could be more beneficial than depth information, particularly for specific object categories. The observed category-specific variations also provide insights for targeted feature engineering and dataset design improvements, potentially leading to more efficient and accurate object detection systems.

Title: Controlling Language and Diffusion Models by Transporting Activations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23054
Summary: The increasing capabilities of large generative models and their ever more widespread deployment have raised concerns about their reliability, safety, and potential misuse. To address these issues, recent works have proposed to control model generation by steering model activations in order to effectively induce or prevent the emergence of concepts or behaviors in the generated output. In this paper we introduce Activation Transport (AcT), a general framework to steer activations guided by optimal transport theory that generalizes many previous activation-steering works. AcT is modality-agnostic and provides fine-grained control over the model behavior with negligible computational overhead, while minimally impacting model abilities. We experimentally show the effectiveness and versatility of our approach by addressing key challenges in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models (T2Is). For LLMs, we show that AcT can effectively mitigate toxicity, induce arbitrary concepts, and increase their truthfulness. In T2Is, we show how AcT enables fine-grained style control and concept negation.

Title: Sample-Efficient Alignment for LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01493
Summary: We study methods for efficiently aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences given budgeted online feedback. We first formulate the LLM alignment problem in the frame of contextual dueling bandits. This formulation, subsuming recent paradigms such as online RLHF and online DPO, inherently quests for sample-efficient algorithms that incorporate online active exploration. Leveraging insights from bandit theory, we introduce a unified algorithm based on Thompson sampling and highlight its applications in two distinct LLM alignment scenarios. The practical agent that efficiently implements this algorithm, named SEA (Sample-Efficient Alignment), is empirically validated through extensive experiments across three model scales (1B, 2.8B, 6.9B) and three preference learning algorithms (DPO, IPO, SLiC). The results demonstrate that SEA achieves highly sample-efficient alignment with oracle's preferences, outperforming recent active exploration methods for LLMs. Additionally, we release the implementation of SEA together with an efficient codebase designed for online alignment of LLMs, aiming to accelerate future research in this field.

Title: DreamPolish: Domain Score Distillation With Progressive Geometry Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01602
Summary: We introduce DreamPolish, a text-to-3D generation model that excels in producing refined geometry and high-quality textures. In the geometry construction phase, our approach leverages multiple neural representations to enhance the stability of the synthesis process. Instead of relying solely on a view-conditioned diffusion prior in the novel sampled views, which often leads to undesired artifacts in the geometric surface, we incorporate an additional normal estimator to polish the geometry details, conditioned on viewpoints with varying field-of-views. We propose to add a surface polishing stage with only a few training steps, which can effectively refine the artifacts attributed to limited guidance from previous stages and produce 3D objects with more desirable geometry. The key topic of texture generation using pretrained text-to-image models is to find a suitable domain in the vast latent distribution of these models that contains photorealistic and consistent renderings. In the texture generation phase, we introduce a novel score distillation objective, namely domain score distillation (DSD), to guide neural representations toward such a domain. We draw inspiration from the classifier-free guidance (CFG) in textconditioned image generation tasks and show that CFG and variational distribution guidance represent distinct aspects in gradient guidance and are both imperative domains for the enhancement of texture quality. Extensive experiments show our proposed model can produce 3D assets with polished surfaces and photorealistic textures, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Zebra-Llama: A Context-Aware Large Language Model for Democratizing Rare Disease Knowledge
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02657
Summary: Rare diseases present unique challenges in healthcare, often suffering from delayed diagnosis and fragmented information landscapes. The scarcity of reliable knowledge in these conditions poses a distinct challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in supporting clinical management and delivering precise patient information underscoring the need for focused training on these 'zebra' cases. We present Zebra-Llama, a specialized context-aware language model with high precision Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capability, focusing on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) as our case study. EDS, affecting 1 in 5,000 individuals, exemplifies the complexities of rare diseases with its diverse symptoms, multiple subtypes, and evolving diagnostic criteria. By implementing a novel context-aware fine-tuning methodology trained on questions derived from medical literature, patient experiences, and clinical resources, along with expertly curated responses, Zebra-Llama demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in handling EDS-related queries. On a test set of real-world questions collected from EDS patients and clinicians, medical experts evaluated the responses generated by both models, revealing Zebra-Llama's substantial improvements over base model (Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct) in thoroughness (77.5% vs. 70.1%), accuracy (83.0% vs. 78.8%), clarity (74.7% vs. 72.0%) and citation reliability (70.6% vs. 52.3%). Released as an open-source resource, Zebra-Llama not only provides more accessible and reliable EDS information but also establishes a framework for developing specialized AI solutions for other rare conditions. This work represents a crucial step towards democratizing expert-level knowledge in rare disease management, potentially transforming how healthcare providers and patients navigate the complex landscape of rare diseases.

Title: LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular Graph Assistant
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00871
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and instruction-following capabilities with instruction tuning. The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to-end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction. The code of LLaMo is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/LLaMo.

Title: DeeR-VLA: Dynamic Inference of Multimodal Large Language Models for Efficient Robot Execution
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02359
Summary: MLLMs have demonstrated remarkable comprehension and reasoning capabilities with complex language and visual data. These advances have spurred the vision of establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex human instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks. However, developing MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically limited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In contrast, the inference of MLLMs involves storing billions of parameters and performing tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands. In our paper, we propose a Dynamic Early-Exit Framework for Robotic Vision-Language-Action Model (DeeR-VLA, or simply DeeR) that automatically adjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The approach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model to terminate processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for a specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation. Additionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination criteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average computational cost (i.e., power consumption), as well as peak computational consumption (i.e., latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure that DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while maintaining competitive performance. On the CALVIN robot manipulation benchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs of LLM by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory of LLM by 2-6x without compromising performance. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/yueyang130/DeeR-VLA.

Title: HtmlRAG: HTML is Better Than Plain Text for Modeling Retrieved Knowledge in RAG Systems
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02959
Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been shown to improve knowledge capabilities and alleviate the hallucination problem of LLMs. The Web is a major source of external knowledge used in RAG systems, and many commercial systems such as ChatGPT and Perplexity have used Web search engines as their major retrieval systems. Typically, such RAG systems retrieve search results, download HTML sources of the results, and then extract plain texts from the HTML sources. Plain text documents or chunks are fed into the LLMs to augment the generation. However, much of the structural and semantic information inherent in HTML, such as headings and table structures, is lost during this plain-text-based RAG process. To alleviate this problem, we propose HtmlRAG, which uses HTML instead of plain text as the format of retrieved knowledge in RAG. We believe HTML is better than plain text in modeling knowledge in external documents, and most LLMs possess robust capacities to understand HTML. However, utilizing HTML presents new challenges. HTML contains additional content such as tags, JavaScript, and CSS specifications, which bring extra input tokens and noise to the RAG system. To address this issue, we propose HTML cleaning, compression, and pruning strategies, to shorten the HTML while minimizing the loss of information. Specifically, we design a two-step block-tree-based pruning method that prunes useless HTML blocks and keeps only the relevant part of the HTML. Experiments on six QA datasets confirm the superiority of using HTML in RAG systems.

Title: SALSA: Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation in RLHF
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01798
Summary: In Large Language Model (LLM) development, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning models with human values and preferences. RLHF traditionally relies on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the current policy and a frozen initial policy as a reference, which is added as a penalty in policy optimization algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). While this constraint prevents models from deviating too far from the initial checkpoint, it limits exploration of the reward landscape, reducing the model's ability to discover higher-quality solutions. As a result, policy optimization is often trapped in a narrow region of the parameter space, leading to suboptimal alignment and performance. This paper presents SALSA (Soup-based Alignment Learning for Stronger Adaptation), a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by creating a more flexible and better located reference model through weight-space averaging of two independent supervised fine-tuned (SFT) models. This model soup allows for larger deviation in KL divergence and exploring a promising region of the solution space without sacrificing stability. By leveraging this more robust reference model, SALSA fosters better exploration, achieving higher rewards and improving model robustness, out-of-distribution generalization, and performance. We validate the effectiveness of SALSA through extensive experiments on popular open models (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-2B) across various benchmarks (MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, UltraFeedback), where it consistently surpasses PPO by fostering deeper exploration and achieving superior alignment in LLMs.

Title: AutoVFX: Physically Realistic Video Editing from Natural Language Instructions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02394
Summary: Modern visual effects (VFX) software has made it possible for skilled artists to create imagery of virtually anything. However, the creation process remains laborious, complex, and largely inaccessible to everyday users. In this work, we present AutoVFX, a framework that automatically creates realistic and dynamic VFX videos from a single video and natural language instructions. By carefully integrating neural scene modeling, LLM-based code generation, and physical simulation, AutoVFX is able to provide physically-grounded, photorealistic editing effects that can be controlled directly using natural language instructions. We conduct extensive experiments to validate AutoVFX's efficacy across a diverse spectrum of videos and instructions. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that AutoVFX outperforms all competing methods by a large margin in generative quality, instruction alignment, editing versatility, and physical plausibility.

Title: Constrained Diffusion Implicit Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00359
Summary: This paper describes an efficient algorithm for solving noisy linear inverse problems using pretrained diffusion models. Extending the paradigm of denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), we propose constrained diffusion implicit models (CDIM) that modify the diffusion updates to enforce a constraint upon the final output. For noiseless inverse problems, CDIM exactly satisfies the constraints; in the noisy case, we generalize CDIM to satisfy an exact constraint on the residual distribution of the noise. Experiments across a variety of tasks and metrics show strong performance of CDIM, with analogous inference acceleration to unconstrained DDIM: 10 to 50 times faster than previous conditional diffusion methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach on many problems including super-resolution, denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and 3D point cloud reconstruction.

Title: IGOR: Image-GOal Representations are the Atomic Control Units for Foundation Models in Embodied AI
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00785
Summary: We introduce Image-GOal Representations (IGOR), aiming to learn a unified, semantically consistent action space across human and various robots. Through this unified latent action space, IGOR enables knowledge transfer among large-scale robot and human activity data. We achieve this by compressing visual changes between an initial image and its goal state into latent actions. IGOR allows us to generate latent action labels for internet-scale video data. This unified latent action space enables the training of foundation policy and world models across a wide variety of tasks performed by both robots and humans. We demonstrate that: (1) IGOR learns a semantically consistent action space for both human and robots, characterizing various possible motions of objects representing the physical interaction knowledge; (2) IGOR can "migrate" the movements of the object in the one video to other videos, even across human and robots, by jointly using the latent action model and world model; (3) IGOR can learn to align latent actions with natural language through the foundation policy model, and integrate latent actions with a low-level policy model to achieve effective robot control. We believe IGOR opens new possibilities for human-to-robot knowledge transfer and control.

Title: LoRA-Contextualizing Adaptation of Large Multimodal Models for Long Document Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01106
Summary: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently shown great progress in text-rich image understanding, yet they still struggle with complex, multi-page, visually-rich documents. Traditional methods using document parsers for retrieval-augmented generation suffer from performance and efficiency limitations, while directly presenting all pages to LMMs leads to inefficiencies, especially with lengthy documents. In this work, we present a novel framework named LoRA-Contextualizing Adaptation of Large multimodal models (LoCAL), which broadens the capabilities of any LMM to support long-document understanding. We demonstrate that LMMs can effectively serve as multimodal retrievers, fetching relevant pages to answer user questions based on these pages. LoCAL is implemented with two specific LMM adapters: one for evidence page retrieval and another for question answering. Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of LoCAL.

Title: Multi-expert Prompting Improves Reliability, Safety, and Usefulness of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00492
Summary: We present Multi-expert Prompting, a novel enhancement of ExpertPrompting (Xu et al., 2023), designed to improve the large language model (LLM) generation. Specifically, it guides an LLM to fulfill an input instruction by simulating multiple experts, aggregating their responses, and selecting the best among individual and aggregated responses. This process is performed in a single chain of thoughts through our seven carefully designed subtasks derived from the Nominal Group Technique (Ven and Delbecq, 1974), a well-established decision-making framework. Our evaluations demonstrate that Multi-expert Prompting significantly outperforms ExpertPrompting and comparable baselines in enhancing the truthfulness, factuality, informativeness, and usefulness of responses while reducing toxicity and hurtfulness. It further achieves state-of-the-art truthfulness by outperforming the best baseline by 8.69% with ChatGPT. Multi-expert Prompting is efficient, explainable, and highly adaptable to diverse scenarios, eliminating the need for manual prompt construction.

Title: MVPaint: Synchronized Multi-View Diffusion for Painting Anything 3D
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02336
Summary: Texturing is a crucial step in the 3D asset production workflow, which enhances the visual appeal and diversity of 3D assets. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Texture (T2T) generation, existing methods often yield subpar results, primarily due to local discontinuities, inconsistencies across multiple views, and their heavy dependence on UV unwrapping outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel generation-refinement 3D texturing framework called MVPaint, which can generate high-resolution, seamless textures while emphasizing multi-view consistency. MVPaint mainly consists of three key modules. 1) Synchronized Multi-view Generation (SMG). Given a 3D mesh model, MVPaint first simultaneously generates multi-view images by employing an SMG model, which leads to coarse texturing results with unpainted parts due to missing observations. 2) Spatial-aware 3D Inpainting (S3I). To ensure complete 3D texturing, we introduce the S3I method, specifically designed to effectively texture previously unobserved areas. 3) UV Refinement (UVR). Furthermore, MVPaint employs a UVR module to improve the texture quality in the UV space, which first performs a UV-space Super-Resolution, followed by a Spatial-aware Seam-Smoothing algorithm for revising spatial texturing discontinuities caused by UV unwrapping. Moreover, we establish two T2T evaluation benchmarks: the Objaverse T2T benchmark and the GSO T2T benchmark, based on selected high-quality 3D meshes from the Objaverse dataset and the entire GSO dataset, respectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MVPaint surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, MVPaint could generate high-fidelity textures with minimal Janus issues and highly enhanced cross-view consistency.

Title: PPLLaVA: Varied Video Sequence Understanding With Prompt Guidance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02327
Summary: The past year has witnessed the significant advancement of video-based large language models. However, the challenge of developing a unified model for both short and long video understanding remains unresolved. Most existing video LLMs cannot handle hour-long videos, while methods custom for long videos tend to be ineffective for shorter videos and images. In this paper, we identify the key issue as the redundant content in videos. To address this, we propose a novel pooling strategy that simultaneously achieves token compression and instruction-aware visual feature aggregation. Our model is termed Prompt-guided Pooling LLaVA, or PPLLaVA for short. Specifically, PPLLaVA consists of three core components: the CLIP-based visual-prompt alignment that extracts visual information relevant to the user's instructions, the prompt-guided pooling that compresses the visual sequence to arbitrary scales using convolution-style pooling, and the clip context extension designed for lengthy prompt common in visual dialogue. Moreover, our codebase also integrates the most advanced video Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and visual interleave training. Extensive experiments have validated the performance of our model. With superior throughput and only 1024 visual context, PPLLaVA achieves better results on image benchmarks as a video LLM, while achieving state-of-the-art performance across various video benchmarks, excelling in tasks ranging from caption generation to multiple-choice questions, and handling video lengths from seconds to hours. Codes have been available at https://github.com/farewellthree/PPLLaVA.

Title: "Give Me BF16 or Give Me Death"? Accuracy-Performance Trade-Offs in LLM Quantization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02355
Summary: Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. We present a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, our study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, we also present a couple of quantization improvements which allowed us to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. Our investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3% accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only quantization (W4A16-INT) is competitive with 8-bit integer weight and activation quantization. To address the question of the "best" format for a given deployment environment, we conduct inference performance analysis using the popular open-source vLLM framework on various GPU architectures. We find that W4A16 offers the best cost-efficiency for synchronous deployments, and for asynchronous deployment on mid-tier GPUs. At the same time, W8A8 formats excel in asynchronous "continuous batching" deployment of mid- and large-size models on high-end GPUs. Our results provide a set of practical guidelines for deploying quantized LLMs across scales and performance requirements.

Title: Swan and ArabicMTEB: Dialect-Aware, Arabic-Centric, Cross-Lingual, and Cross-Cultural Embedding Models and Benchmarks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01192
Summary: We introduce Swan, a family of embedding models centred around the Arabic language, addressing both small-scale and large-scale use cases. Swan includes two variants: Swan-Small, based on ARBERTv2, and Swan-Large, built on ArMistral, a pretrained Arabic large language model. To evaluate these models, we propose ArabicMTEB, a comprehensive benchmark suite that assesses cross-lingual, multi-dialectal, multi-domain, and multi-cultural Arabic text embedding performance, covering eight diverse tasks and spanning 94 datasets. Swan-Large achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming Multilingual-E5-large in most Arabic tasks, while the Swan-Small consistently surpasses Multilingual-E5 base. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that Swan models are both dialectally and culturally aware, excelling across various Arabic domains while offering significant monetary efficiency. This work significantly advances the field of Arabic language modelling and provides valuable resources for future research and applications in Arabic natural language processing. Our models and benchmark will be made publicly accessible for research.

Title: Survey of Cultural Awareness in Language Models: Text and Beyond
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00860
Summary: Large-scale deployment of large language models (LLMs) in various applications, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, requires LLMs to be culturally sensitive to the user to ensure inclusivity. Culture has been widely studied in psychology and anthropology, and there has been a recent surge in research on making LLMs more culturally inclusive in LLMs that goes beyond multilinguality and builds on findings from psychology and anthropology. In this paper, we survey efforts towards incorporating cultural awareness into text-based and multimodal LLMs. We start by defining cultural awareness in LLMs, taking the definitions of culture from anthropology and psychology as a point of departure. We then examine methodologies adopted for creating cross-cultural datasets, strategies for cultural inclusion in downstream tasks, and methodologies that have been used for benchmarking cultural awareness in LLMs. Further, we discuss the ethical implications of cultural alignment, the role of Human-Computer Interaction in driving cultural inclusion in LLMs, and the role of cultural alignment in driving social science research. We finally provide pointers to future research based on our findings about gaps in the literature.

Title: DynaSaur: Large Language Agents Beyond Predefined Actions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01747
Summary: Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and predefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed, narrowly-scoped environments, we argue that it presents two major challenges when deploying LLM agents in real-world scenarios: (1) selecting from a fixed set of actions significantly restricts the planning and acting capabilities of LLM agents, and (2) this approach requires substantial human effort to enumerate and implement all possible actions, which becomes impractical in complex environments with a vast number of potential actions. In this work, we propose an LLM agent framework that enables the dynamic creation and composition of actions in an online manner. In this framework, the agent interacts with the environment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose programming language at each step. Furthermore, generated actions are accumulated over time for future reuse. Our extensive experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that this framework offers significantly greater flexibility and outperforms previous methods. Notably, it allows an LLM agent to recover in scenarios where no relevant action exists in the predefined set or when existing actions fail due to unforeseen edge cases. At the time of writing, we hold the top position on the GAIA public leaderboard. Our code can be found in https://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur{https://github.com/adobe-research/dynasaur}.

Title: Training-free Regional Prompting for Diffusion Transformers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02395
Summary: Diffusion models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in text-to-image generation. Their semantic understanding (i.e., prompt following) ability has also been greatly improved with large language models (e.g., T5, Llama). However, existing models cannot perfectly handle long and complex text prompts, especially when the text prompts contain various objects with numerous attributes and interrelated spatial relationships. While many regional prompting methods have been proposed for UNet-based models (SD1.5, SDXL), but there are still no implementations based on the recent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, such as SD3 and FLUX.1.In this report, we propose and implement regional prompting for FLUX.1 based on attention manipulation, which enables DiT with fined-grained compositional text-to-image generation capability in a training-free manner. Code is available at https://github.com/antonioo-c/Regional-Prompting-FLUX.

Title: GenXD: Generating Any 3D and 4D Scenes
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02319
Summary: Recent developments in 2D visual generation have been remarkably successful. However, 3D and 4D generation remain challenging in real-world applications due to the lack of large-scale 4D data and effective model design. In this paper, we propose to jointly investigate general 3D and 4D generation by leveraging camera and object movements commonly observed in daily life. Due to the lack of real-world 4D data in the community, we first propose a data curation pipeline to obtain camera poses and object motion strength from videos. Based on this pipeline, we introduce a large-scale real-world 4D scene dataset: CamVid-30K. By leveraging all the 3D and 4D data, we develop our framework, GenXD, which allows us to produce any 3D or 4D scene. We propose multiview-temporal modules, which disentangle camera and object movements, to seamlessly learn from both 3D and 4D data. Additionally, GenXD employs masked latent conditions to support a variety of conditioning views. GenXD can generate videos that follow the camera trajectory as well as consistent 3D views that can be lifted into 3D representations. We perform extensive evaluations across various real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating GenXD's effectiveness and versatility compared to previous methods in 3D and 4D generation.

PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02265
Summary: In this paper, we introduce Hunyuan-Large, which is currently the largest open-source Transformer-based mixture of experts model, with a total of 389 billion parameters and 52 billion activation parameters, capable of handling up to 256K tokens. We conduct a thorough evaluation of Hunyuan-Large's superior performance across various benchmarks including language understanding and generation, logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, coding, long-context, and aggregated tasks, where it outperforms LLama3.1-70B and exhibits comparable performance when compared to the significantly larger LLama3.1-405B model. Key practice of Hunyuan-Large include large-scale synthetic data that is orders larger than in previous literature, a mixed expert routing strategy, a key-value cache compression technique, and an expert-specific learning rate strategy. Additionally, we also investigate the scaling laws and learning rate schedule of mixture of experts models, providing valuable insights and guidances for future model development and optimization. The code and checkpoints of Hunyuan-Large are released to facilitate future innovations and applications.

Title: Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02335
Summary: Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-p% sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., 1-sparsity ratio) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.

Title: AndroidLab: Training and Systematic Benchmarking of Android Autonomous Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24024
Summary: Autonomous agents have become increasingly important for interacting with the real world. Android agents, in particular, have been recently a frequently-mentioned interaction method. However, existing studies for training and evaluating Android agents lack systematic research on both open-source and closed-source models. In this work, we propose AndroidLab as a systematic Android agent framework. It includes an operation environment with different modalities, action space, and a reproducible benchmark. It supports both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs) in the same action space. AndroidLab benchmark includes predefined Android virtual devices and 138 tasks across nine apps built on these devices. By using the AndroidLab environment, we develop an Android Instruction dataset and train six open-source LLMs and LMMs, lifting the average success rates from 4.59% to 21.50% for LLMs and from 1.93% to 13.28% for LMMs. AndroidLab is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/Android-Lab.

Title: WebRL: Training LLM Web Agents via Self-Evolving Online Curriculum Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02337
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential as autonomous agents, particularly in web-based tasks. However, existing LLM web agents heavily rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs, while open LLMs lack the necessary decision-making capabilities. This paper introduces WebRL, a self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning framework designed to train high-performance web agents using open LLMs. WebRL addresses three key challenges in building LLM web agents, including the scarcity of training tasks, sparse feedback signals, and policy distribution drift in online learning. Specifically, WebRL incorporates 1) a self-evolving curriculum that generates new tasks from unsuccessful attempts, 2) a robust outcome-supervised reward model (ORM), and 3) adaptive reinforcement learning strategies to ensure consistent improvements. We apply WebRL to transform open Llama-3.1 and GLM-4 models into proficient web agents. On WebArena-Lite, WebRL improves the success rate of Llama-3.1-8B from 4.8% to 42.4%, and from 6.1% to 43% for GLM-4-9B. These open models significantly surpass the performance of GPT-4-Turbo (17.6%) and GPT-4o (13.9%) and outperform previous state-of-the-art web agents trained on open LLMs (AutoWebGLM, 18.2%). Our findings demonstrate WebRL's effectiveness in bridging the gap between open and proprietary LLM-based web agents, paving the way for more accessible and powerful autonomous web interaction systems.

Title: Adaptive Caching for Faster Video Generation with Diffusion Transformers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02397
Summary: Generating temporally-consistent high-fidelity videos can be computationally expensive, especially over longer temporal spans. More-recent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) -- despite making significant headway in this context -- have only heightened such challenges as they rely on larger models and heavier attention mechanisms, resulting in slower inference speeds. In this paper, we introduce a training-free method to accelerate video DiTs, termed Adaptive Caching (AdaCache), which is motivated by the fact that "not all videos are created equal": meaning, some videos require fewer denoising steps to attain a reasonable quality than others. Building on this, we not only cache computations through the diffusion process, but also devise a caching schedule tailored to each video generation, maximizing the quality-latency trade-off. We further introduce a Motion Regularization (MoReg) scheme to utilize video information within AdaCache, essentially controlling the compute allocation based on motion content. Altogether, our plug-and-play contributions grant significant inference speedups (e.g. up to 4.7x on Open-Sora 720p - 2s video generation) without sacrificing the generation quality, across multiple video DiT baselines.

Title: Decoding Dark Matter: Specialized Sparse Autoencoders for Interpreting Rare Concepts in Foundation Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00743
Summary: Understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with foundation models (FMs) hinges on developing effective interpretability methods. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. We introduce Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. We present a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. Our evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and L_0 sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. We showcase the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5\% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains.

Title: How Far is Video Generation from World Model: A Physical Law Perspective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02385
Summary: OpenAI's Sora highlights the potential of video generation for developing world models that adhere to fundamental physical laws. However, the ability of video generation models to discover such laws purely from visual data without human priors can be questioned. A world model learning the true law should give predictions robust to nuances and correctly extrapolate on unseen scenarios. In this work, we evaluate across three key scenarios: in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and combinatorial generalization. We developed a 2D simulation testbed for object movement and collisions to generate videos deterministically governed by one or more classical mechanics laws. This provides an unlimited supply of data for large-scale experimentation and enables quantitative evaluation of whether the generated videos adhere to physical laws. We trained diffusion-based video generation models to predict object movements based on initial frames. Our scaling experiments show perfect generalization within the distribution, measurable scaling behavior for combinatorial generalization, but failure in out-of-distribution scenarios. Further experiments reveal two key insights about the generalization mechanisms of these models: (1) the models fail to abstract general physical rules and instead exhibit "case-based" generalization behavior, i.e., mimicking the closest training example; (2) when generalizing to new cases, models are observed to prioritize different factors when referencing training data: color > size > velocity > shape. Our study suggests that scaling alone is insufficient for video generation models to uncover fundamental physical laws, despite its role in Sora's broader success.

Title: LIBMoE: A Library for comprehensive benchmarking Mixture of Experts in Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00918
Summary: Mixture of Experts (MoEs) plays an important role in the development of more efficient and effective large language models (LLMs). Due to the enormous resource requirements, studying large scale MoE algorithms remain in-accessible to many researchers. This work develops LibMoE, a comprehensive and modular framework to streamline the research, training, and evaluation of MoE algorithms. Built upon three core principles: (i) modular design, (ii) efficient training; (iii) comprehensive evaluation, LibMoE brings MoE in LLMs more accessible to a wide range of researchers by standardizing the training and evaluation pipelines. Using LibMoE, we extensively benchmarked five state-of-the-art MoE algorithms over three different LLMs and 11 datasets under the zero-shot setting. The results show that despite the unique characteristics, all MoE algorithms perform roughly similar when averaged across a wide range of tasks. With the modular design and extensive evaluation, we believe LibMoE will be invaluable for researchers to make meaningful progress towards the next generation of MoE and LLMs. Project page: https://fsoft-aic.github.io/fsoft-LibMoE.github.io.

Title: DynaMath: A Dynamic Visual Benchmark for Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning Robustness of Vision Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00836
Summary: The rapid advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great potential in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks that involve visual context. Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that SOTA VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the mathematical reasoning robustness in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce DynaMath, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. DynaMath includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic seed questions, each represented as a Python program. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of concrete questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. DynaMath allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 SOTA VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions. Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and DynaMath provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning.

Title: Fashion-VDM: Video Diffusion Model for Virtual Try-On
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00225
Summary: We present Fashion-VDM, a video diffusion model (VDM) for generating virtual try-on videos. Given an input garment image and person video, our method aims to generate a high-quality try-on video of the person wearing the given garment, while preserving the person's identity and motion. Image-based virtual try-on has shown impressive results; however, existing video virtual try-on (VVT) methods are still lacking garment details and temporal consistency. To address these issues, we propose a diffusion-based architecture for video virtual try-on, split classifier-free guidance for increased control over the conditioning inputs, and a progressive temporal training strategy for single-pass 64-frame, 512px video generation. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of joint image-video training for video try-on, especially when video data is limited. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our approach sets the new state-of-the-art for video virtual try-on.

Title: Physics in Next-token Prediction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00660
Summary: We discovered the underlying physics in Next-token Prediction (NTP). We identified the law of information conservation within NTP and proposed the First Law of Information Capacity (IC-1), demonstrating that the essence of intelligence emergence in auto-regressive models is fundamentally a process of information transfer. We also introduced Landauer's Principle into NTP, formulating the Second Law of Information Capacity (IC-2), which establishes the relationship between auto-regressive model training and energy consumption. Additionally, we presented several corollaries, which hold practical significance for production practices. Finally, we validated the compatibility and complementarity of our findings with existing theories.

Title: TOMATO: Assessing Visual Temporal Reasoning Capabilities in Multimodal Foundation Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23266
Summary: Existing benchmarks often highlight the remarkable performance achieved by state-of-the-art Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) in leveraging temporal context for video understanding. However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.

Title: CityGaussianV2: Efficient and Geometrically Accurate Reconstruction for Large-Scale Scenes
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00771
Summary: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized radiance field reconstruction, manifesting efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. However, accurately representing surfaces, especially in large and complex scenarios, remains a significant challenge due to the unstructured nature of 3DGS. In this paper, we present CityGaussianV2, a novel approach for large-scale scene reconstruction that addresses critical challenges related to geometric accuracy and efficiency. Building on the favorable generalization capabilities of 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), we address its convergence and scalability issues. Specifically, we implement a decomposed-gradient-based densification and depth regression technique to eliminate blurry artifacts and accelerate convergence. To scale up, we introduce an elongation filter that mitigates Gaussian count explosion caused by 2DGS degeneration. Furthermore, we optimize the CityGaussian pipeline for parallel training, achieving up to 10times compression, at least 25% savings in training time, and a 50% decrease in memory usage. We also established standard geometry benchmarks under large-scale scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method strikes a promising balance between visual quality, geometric accuracy, as well as storage and training costs.

Title: Face Anonymization Made Simple
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00762
Summary: Current face anonymization techniques often depend on identity loss calculated by face recognition models, which can be inaccurate and unreliable. Additionally, many methods require supplementary data such as facial landmarks and masks to guide the synthesis process. In contrast, our approach uses diffusion models with only a reconstruction loss, eliminating the need for facial landmarks or masks while still producing images with intricate, fine-grained details. We validated our results on two public benchmarks through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three key areas: identity anonymization, facial attribute preservation, and image quality. Beyond its primary function of anonymization, our model can also perform face swapping tasks by incorporating an additional facial image as input, demonstrating its versatility and potential for diverse applications. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/hanweikung/face_anon_simple .

Title: GPT or BERT: why not both?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.24159
Summary: We present a simple way to merge masked language modeling with causal language modeling. This hybrid training objective results in a model that combines the strengths of both modeling paradigms within a single transformer stack: GPT-BERT can be transparently used like any standard causal or masked language model. We test the pretraining process that enables this flexible behavior on the BabyLM Challenge 2024. The results show that the hybrid pretraining outperforms masked-only or causal-only models. We openly release the models, training corpora and code.

Title: Zipfian Whitening
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00680
Summary: The word embedding space in neural models is skewed, and correcting this can improve task performance. We point out that most approaches for modeling, correcting, and measuring the symmetry of an embedding space implicitly assume that the word frequencies are uniform; in reality, word frequencies follow a highly non-uniform distribution, known as Zipf's law. Surprisingly, simply performing PCA whitening weighted by the empirical word frequency that follows Zipf's law significantly improves task performance, surpassing established baselines. From a theoretical perspective, both our approach and existing methods can be clearly categorized: word representations are distributed according to an exponential family with either uniform or Zipfian base measures. By adopting the latter approach, we can naturally emphasize informative low-frequency words in terms of their vector norm, which becomes evident from the information-geometric perspective, and in terms of the loss functions for imbalanced classification. Additionally, our theory corroborates that popular natural language processing methods, such as skip-gram negative sampling, WhiteningBERT, and headless language models, work well just because their word embeddings encode the empirical word frequency into the underlying probabilistic model.

Title: Constant Acceleration Flow
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00322
Summary: Rectified flow and reflow procedures have significantly advanced fast generation by progressively straightening ordinary differential equation (ODE) flows. They operate under the assumption that image and noise pairs, known as couplings, can be approximated by straight trajectories with constant velocity. However, we observe that modeling with constant velocity and using reflow procedures have limitations in accurately learning straight trajectories between pairs, resulting in suboptimal performance in few-step generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), a novel framework based on a simple constant acceleration equation. CAF introduces acceleration as an additional learnable variable, allowing for more expressive and accurate estimation of the ODE flow. Moreover, we propose two techniques to further improve estimation accuracy: initial velocity conditioning for the acceleration model and a reflow process for the initial velocity. Our comprehensive studies on toy datasets, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet 64x64 demonstrate that CAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for one-step generation. We also show that CAF dramatically improves few-step coupling preservation and inversion over Rectified flow. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CAF{https://github.com/mlvlab/CAF}.

Title: WikiNER-fr-gold: A Gold-Standard NER Corpus
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00030
Summary: We address in this article the the quality of the WikiNER corpus, a multilingual Named Entity Recognition corpus, and provide a consolidated version of it. The annotation of WikiNER was produced in a semi-supervised manner i.e. no manual verification has been carried out a posteriori. Such corpus is called silver-standard. In this paper we propose WikiNER-fr-gold which is a revised version of the French proportion of WikiNER. Our corpus consists of randomly sampled 20% of the original French sub-corpus (26,818 sentences with 700k tokens). We start by summarizing the entity types included in each category in order to define an annotation guideline, and then we proceed to revise the corpus. Finally we present an analysis of errors and inconsistency observed in the WikiNER-fr corpus, and we discuss potential future work directions.

Title: OS-ATLAS: A Foundation Action Model for Generalist GUI Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23218
Summary: Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of robust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and GeminiProVision. Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.

Title: SambaMixer: State of Health Prediction of Li-ion Batteries using Mamba State Space Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00233
Summary: The state of health (SOH) of a Li-ion battery is a critical parameter that determines the remaining capacity and the remaining lifetime of the battery. In this paper, we propose SambaMixer a novel structured state space model (SSM) for predicting the state of health of Li-ion batteries. The proposed SSM is based on the MambaMixer architecture, which is designed to handle multi-variate time signals. We evaluate our model on the NASA battery discharge dataset and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on this dataset. We further introduce a novel anchor-based resampling method which ensures time signals are of the expected length while also serving as augmentation technique. Finally, we condition prediction on the sample time and the cycle time difference using positional encodings to improve the performance of our model and to learn recuperation effects. Our results proof that our model is able to predict the SOH of Li-ion batteries with high accuracy and robustness.
