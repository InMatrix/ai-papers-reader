Title: LongLLaVA: Scaling Multi-modal LLMs to 1000 Images Efficiently via Hybrid Architecture
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02889
Summary: Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is crucial for video understanding, high-resolution image understanding, and multi-modal agents. This involves a series of systematic optimizations, including model architecture, data construction and training strategy, particularly addressing challenges such as degraded performance with more images and high computational costs. In this paper, we adapt the model architecture to a hybrid of Mamba and Transformer blocks, approach data construction with both temporal and spatial dependencies among multiple images and employ a progressive training strategy. The released model LongLLaVA~(Long-Context Large Language and Vision Assistant) is the first hybrid MLLM, which achieved a better balance between efficiency and effectiveness. LongLLaVA not only achieves competitive results across various benchmarks, but also maintains high throughput and low memory consumption. Especially, it could process nearly a thousand images on a single A100 80GB GPU, showing promising application prospects for a wide range of tasks.

Title: Political DEBATE: Efficient Zero-shot and Few-shot Classifiers for Political Text
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02078
Summary: Social scientists quickly adopted large language models due to their ability to annotate documents without supervised training, an ability known as zero-shot learning. However, due to their compute demands, cost, and often proprietary nature, these models are often at odds with replication and open science standards. This paper introduces the Political DEBATE (DeBERTa Algorithm for Textual Entailment) language models for zero-shot and few-shot classification of political documents. These models are not only as good, or better than, state-of-the art large language models at zero and few-shot classification, but are orders of magnitude more efficient and completely open source. By training the models on a simple random sample of 10-25 documents, they can outperform supervised classifiers trained on hundreds or thousands of documents and state-of-the-art generative models with complex, engineered prompts. Additionally, we release the PolNLI dataset used to train these models -- a corpus of over 200,000 political documents with highly accurate labels across over 800 classification tasks.

Title: FastVoiceGrad: One-step Diffusion-Based Voice Conversion with Adversarial Conditional Diffusion Distillation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02245
Summary: Diffusion-based voice conversion (VC) techniques such as VoiceGrad have attracted interest because of their high VC performance in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity. However, a notable limitation is the slow inference caused by the multi-step reverse diffusion. Therefore, we propose FastVoiceGrad, a novel one-step diffusion-based VC that reduces the number of iterations from dozens to one while inheriting the high VC performance of the multi-step diffusion-based VC. We obtain the model using adversarial conditional diffusion distillation (ACDD), leveraging the ability of generative adversarial networks and diffusion models while reconsidering the initial states in sampling. Evaluations of one-shot any-to-any VC demonstrate that FastVoiceGrad achieves VC performance superior to or comparable to that of previous multi-step diffusion-based VC while enhancing the inference speed. Audio samples are available at https://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/people/kaneko.takuhiro/projects/fastvoicegrad/.

Title: Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01083
Summary: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised Flow Matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance with language prompter achieves competitive performance and even outperforms other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot trajectories with a single flow matching policy also leads to consistently better performance than alternative behavior cloning methods, especially given multimodal robot action distributions. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance model learning and trajectory generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.

Title: Arctic-SnowCoder: Demystifying High-Quality Data in Code Pretraining
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02326
Summary: Recent studies have been increasingly demonstrating that high-quality data is crucial for effective pretraining of language models. However, the precise definition of "high-quality" remains underexplored. Focusing on the code domain, we introduce Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B, a data-efficient base code model pretrained on 555B tokens through three phases of progressively refined data: (1) general pretraining with 500B standard-quality code tokens, preprocessed through basic filtering, deduplication, and decontamination, (2) continued pretraining with 50B high-quality tokens, selected from phase one by a BERT-style quality annotator trained to distinguish good code from random data, using positive examples drawn from high-quality code files, along with instruction data from Magicoder and StarCoder2-Instruct, and (3) enhanced pretraining with 5B synthetic data created by Llama-3.1-70B using phase two data as seeds, adapting the Magicoder approach for pretraining. Despite being trained on a limited dataset, Arctic-SnowCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance on BigCodeBench, a coding benchmark focusing on practical and challenging programming tasks, compared to similarly sized models trained on no more than 1T tokens, outperforming Phi-1.5-1.3B by 36%. Across all evaluated benchmarks, Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B beats StarCoderBase-3B pretrained on 1T tokens. Additionally, it matches the performance of leading small base code models trained on trillions of tokens. For example, Arctic-SnowCoder-1.3B surpasses StarCoder2-3B, pretrained on over 3.3T tokens, on HumanEval+, a benchmark that evaluates function-level code generation, and remains competitive on BigCodeBench. Our evaluation presents a comprehensive analysis justifying various design choices for Arctic-SnowCoder. Most importantly, we find that the key to high-quality data is its alignment with the distribution of downstream applications.

Title: MMMU-Pro: A More Robust Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02813
Summary: This paper introduces MMMU-Pro, a robust version of the Massive Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning (MMMU) benchmark. MMMU-Pro rigorously assesses multimodal models' true understanding and reasoning capabilities through a three-step process based on MMMU: (1) filtering out questions answerable by text-only models, (2) augmenting candidate options, and (3) introducing a vision-only input setting where questions are embedded within images. This setting challenges AI to truly "see" and "read" simultaneously, testing a fundamental human cognitive skill of seamlessly integrating visual and textual information. Results show that model performance is substantially lower on MMMU-Pro than on MMMU, ranging from 16.8% to 26.9% across models. We explore the impact of OCR prompts and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, finding that OCR prompts have minimal effect while CoT generally improves performance. MMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool, closely mimicking real-world scenarios and offering valuable directions for future research in multimodal AI.

Title: Loopy: Taming Audio-Driven Portrait Avatar with Long-Term Motion Dependency
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02634
Summary: With the introduction of diffusion-based video generation techniques, audio-conditioned human video generation has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in both the naturalness of motion and the synthesis of portrait details. Due to the limited control of audio signals in driving human motion, existing methods often add auxiliary spatial signals to stabilize movements, which may compromise the naturalness and freedom of motion. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end audio-only conditioned video diffusion model named Loopy. Specifically, we designed an inter- and intra-clip temporal module and an audio-to-latents module, enabling the model to leverage long-term motion information from the data to learn natural motion patterns and improving audio-portrait movement correlation. This method removes the need for manually specified spatial motion templates used in existing methods to constrain motion during inference. Extensive experiments show that Loopy outperforms recent audio-driven portrait diffusion models, delivering more lifelike and high-quality results across various scenarios.

Title: LongCite: Enabling LLMs to Generate Fine-grained Citations in Long-context QA
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02897
Summary: Though current long-context large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capacities in answering user questions based on extensive text, the lack of citations in their responses makes user verification difficult, leading to concerns about their trustworthiness due to their potential hallucinations. In this work, we aim to enable long-context LLMs to generate responses with fine-grained sentence-level citations, improving their faithfulness and verifiability. We first introduce LongBench-Cite, an automated benchmark for assessing current LLMs' performance in Long-Context Question Answering with Citations (LQAC), revealing considerable room for improvement. To this end, we propose CoF (Coarse to Fine), a novel pipeline that utilizes off-the-shelf LLMs to automatically generate long-context QA instances with precise sentence-level citations, and leverage this pipeline to construct LongCite-45k, a large-scale SFT dataset for LQAC. Finally, we train LongCite-8B and LongCite-9B using the LongCite-45k dataset, successfully enabling their generation of accurate responses and fine-grained sentence-level citations in a single output. The evaluation results on LongBench-Cite show that our trained models achieve state-of-the-art citation quality, surpassing advanced proprietary models including GPT-4o.

Title: General OCR Theory: Towards OCR-2.0 via a Unified End-to-end Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01704
Summary: Traditional OCR systems (OCR-1.0) are increasingly unable to meet people's usage due to the growing demand for intelligent processing of man-made optical characters. In this paper, we collectively refer to all artificial optical signals (e.g., plain texts, math/molecular formulas, tables, charts, sheet music, and even geometric shapes) as "characters" and propose the General OCR Theory along with an excellent model, namely GOT, to promote the arrival of OCR-2.0. The GOT, with 580M parameters, is a unified, elegant, and end-to-end model, consisting of a high-compression encoder and a long-contexts decoder. As an OCR-2.0 model, GOT can handle all the above "characters" under various OCR tasks. On the input side, the model supports commonly used scene- and document-style images in slice and whole-page styles. On the output side, GOT can generate plain or formatted results (markdown/tikz/smiles/kern) via an easy prompt. Besides, the model enjoys interactive OCR features, i.e., region-level recognition guided by coordinates or colors. Furthermore, we also adapt dynamic resolution and multi-page OCR technologies to GOT for better practicality. In experiments, we provide sufficient results to prove the superiority of our model.

Title: PrivacyLens: Evaluating Privacy Norm Awareness of Language Models in Action
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00138
Summary: As language models (LMs) are widely utilized in personalized communication scenarios (e.g., sending emails, writing social media posts) and endowed with a certain level of agency, ensuring they act in accordance with the contextual privacy norms becomes increasingly critical. However, quantifying the privacy norm awareness of LMs and the emerging privacy risk in LM-mediated communication is challenging due to (1) the contextual and long-tailed nature of privacy-sensitive cases, and (2) the lack of evaluation approaches that capture realistic application scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PrivacyLens, a novel framework designed to extend privacy-sensitive seeds into expressive vignettes and further into agent trajectories, enabling multi-level evaluation of privacy leakage in LM agents' actions. We instantiate PrivacyLens with a collection of privacy norms grounded in privacy literature and crowdsourced seeds. Using this dataset, we reveal a discrepancy between LM performance in answering probing questions and their actual behavior when executing user instructions in an agent setup. State-of-the-art LMs, like GPT-4 and Llama-3-70B, leak sensitive information in 25.68% and 38.69% of cases, even when prompted with privacy-enhancing instructions. We also demonstrate the dynamic nature of PrivacyLens by extending each seed into multiple trajectories to red-team LM privacy leakage risk. Dataset and code are available at https://github.com/SALT-NLP/PrivacyLens.

Title: GenAgent: Build Collaborative AI Systems with Automated Workflow Generation -- Case Studies on ComfyUI
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01392
Summary: Much previous AI research has focused on developing monolithic models to maximize their intelligence and capability, with the primary goal of enhancing performance on specific tasks. In contrast, this paper explores an alternative approach: collaborative AI systems that use workflows to integrate models, data sources, and pipelines to solve complex and diverse tasks. We introduce GenAgent, an LLM-based framework that automatically generates complex workflows, offering greater flexibility and scalability compared to monolithic models. The core innovation of GenAgent lies in representing workflows with code, alongside constructing workflows with collaborative agents in a step-by-step manner. We implement GenAgent on the ComfyUI platform and propose a new benchmark, OpenComfy. The results demonstrate that GenAgent outperforms baseline approaches in both run-level and task-level evaluations, showing its capability to generate complex workflows with superior effectiveness and stability.

Title: Know When to Fuse: Investigating Non-English Hybrid Retrieval in the Legal Domain
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01357
Summary: Hybrid search has emerged as an effective strategy to offset the limitations of different matching paradigms, especially in out-of-domain contexts where notable improvements in retrieval quality have been observed. However, existing research predominantly focuses on a limited set of retrieval methods, evaluated in pairs on domain-general datasets exclusively in English. In this work, we study the efficacy of hybrid search across a variety of prominent retrieval models within the unexplored field of law in the French language, assessing both zero-shot and in-domain scenarios. Our findings reveal that in a zero-shot context, fusing different domain-general models consistently enhances performance compared to using a standalone model, regardless of the fusion method. Surprisingly, when models are trained in-domain, we find that fusion generally diminishes performance relative to using the best single system, unless fusing scores with carefully tuned weights. These novel insights, among others, expand the applicability of prior findings across a new field and language, and contribute to a deeper understanding of hybrid search in non-English specialized domains.

Title: The MERIT Dataset: Modelling and Efficiently Rendering Interpretable Transcripts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00447
Summary: This paper introduces the MERIT Dataset, a multimodal (text + image + layout) fully labeled dataset within the context of school reports. Comprising over 400 labels and 33k samples, the MERIT Dataset is a valuable resource for training models in demanding Visually-rich Document Understanding (VrDU) tasks. By its nature (student grade reports), the MERIT Dataset can potentially include biases in a controlled way, making it a valuable tool to benchmark biases induced in Language Models (LLMs). The paper outlines the dataset's generation pipeline and highlights its main features in the textual, visual, layout, and bias domains. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we present a benchmark with token classification models, showing that the dataset poses a significant challenge even for SOTA models and that these would greatly benefit from including samples from the MERIT Dataset in their pretraining phase.

Title: Follow-Your-Canvas: Higher-Resolution Video Outpainting with Extensive Content Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01055
Summary: This paper explores higher-resolution video outpainting with extensive content generation. We point out common issues faced by existing methods when attempting to largely outpaint videos: the generation of low-quality content and limitations imposed by GPU memory. To address these challenges, we propose a diffusion-based method called Follow-Your-Canvas. It builds upon two core designs. First, instead of employing the common practice of "single-shot" outpainting, we distribute the task across spatial windows and seamlessly merge them. It allows us to outpaint videos of any size and resolution without being constrained by GPU memory. Second, the source video and its relative positional relation are injected into the generation process of each window. It makes the generated spatial layout within each window harmonize with the source video. Coupling with these two designs enables us to generate higher-resolution outpainting videos with rich content while keeping spatial and temporal consistency. Follow-Your-Canvas excels in large-scale video outpainting, e.g., from 512X512 to 1152X2048 (9X), while producing high-quality and aesthetically pleasing results. It achieves the best quantitative results across various resolution and scale setups. The code is released on https://github.com/mayuelala/FollowYourCanvas

Title: ContextCite: Attributing Model Generation to Context
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00729
Summary: How do language models use information provided as context when generating a response? Can we infer whether a particular generated statement is actually grounded in the context, a misinterpretation, or fabricated? To help answer these questions, we introduce the problem of context attribution: pinpointing the parts of the context (if any) that led a model to generate a particular statement. We then present ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution that can be applied on top of any existing language model. Finally, we showcase the utility of ContextCite through three applications: (1) helping verify generated statements (2) improving response quality by pruning the context and (3) detecting poisoning attacks. We provide code for ContextCite at https://github.com/MadryLab/context-cite.

Title: Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00588
Summary: We introduce Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization, DPPO, an algorithmic framework including best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based policies (e.g. Diffusion Policy) in continuous control and robot learning tasks using the policy gradient (PG) method from reinforcement learning (RL). PG methods are ubiquitous in training RL policies with other policy parameterizations; nevertheless, they had been conjectured to be less efficient for diffusion-based policies. Surprisingly, we show that DPPO achieves the strongest overall performance and efficiency for fine-tuning in common benchmarks compared to other RL methods for diffusion-based policies and also compared to PG fine-tuning of other policy parameterizations. Through experimental investigation, we find that DPPO takes advantage of unique synergies between RL fine-tuning and the diffusion parameterization, leading to structured and on-manifold exploration, stable training, and strong policy robustness. We further demonstrate the strengths of DPPO in a range of realistic settings, including simulated robotic tasks with pixel observations, and via zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on robot hardware in a long-horizon, multi-stage manipulation task.

Title: FLUX that Plays Music
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00587
Summary: This paper explores a simple extension of diffusion-based rectified flow Transformers for text-to-music generation, termed as FluxMusic. Generally, along with design in advanced Fluxhttps://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux model, we transfers it into a latent VAE space of mel-spectrum. It involves first applying a sequence of independent attention to the double text-music stream, followed by a stacked single music stream for denoised patch prediction. We employ multiple pre-trained text encoders to sufficiently capture caption semantic information as well as inference flexibility. In between, coarse textual information, in conjunction with time step embeddings, is utilized in a modulation mechanism, while fine-grained textual details are concatenated with the music patch sequence as inputs. Through an in-depth study, we demonstrate that rectified flow training with an optimized architecture significantly outperforms established diffusion methods for the text-to-music task, as evidenced by various automatic metrics and human preference evaluations. Our experimental data, code, and model weights are made publicly available at: https://github.com/feizc/FluxMusic.

Title: Accurate Compression of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Vector Quantization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00492
Summary: Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for high-quality image generation given textual prompts. Their success has driven the rapid development of production-grade diffusion models that consistently increase in size and already contain billions of parameters. As a result, state-of-the-art text-to-image models are becoming less accessible in practice, especially in resource-limited environments. Post-training quantization (PTQ) tackles this issue by compressing the pretrained model weights into lower-bit representations. Recent diffusion quantization techniques primarily rely on uniform scalar quantization, providing decent performance for the models compressed to 4 bits. This work demonstrates that more versatile vector quantization (VQ) may achieve higher compression rates for large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we tailor vector-based PTQ methods to recent billion-scale text-to-image models (SDXL and SDXL-Turbo), and show that the diffusion models of 2B+ parameters compressed to around 3 bits using VQ exhibit the similar image quality and textual alignment as previous 4-bit compression techniques.

Title: VideoLLaMB: Long-context Video Understanding with Recurrent Memory Bridges
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01071
Summary: Recent advancements in large-scale video-language models have shown significant potential for real-time planning and detailed interactions. However, their high computational demands and the scarcity of annotated datasets limit their practicality for academic researchers. In this work, we introduce VideoLLaMB, a novel framework that utilizes temporal memory tokens within bridge layers to allow for the encoding of entire video sequences alongside historical visual data, effectively preserving semantic continuity and enhancing model performance across various tasks. This approach includes recurrent memory tokens and a SceneTilling algorithm, which segments videos into independent semantic units to preserve semantic integrity. Empirically, VideoLLaMB significantly outstrips existing video-language models, demonstrating a 5.5 points improvement over its competitors across three VideoQA benchmarks, and 2.06 points on egocentric planning. Comprehensive results on the MVBench show that VideoLLaMB-7B achieves markedly better results than previous 7B models of same LLM. Remarkably, it maintains robust performance as PLLaVA even as video length increases up to 8 times. Besides, the frame retrieval results on our specialized Needle in a Video Haystack (NIAVH) benchmark, further validate VideoLLaMB's prowess in accurately identifying specific frames within lengthy videos. Our SceneTilling algorithm also enables the generation of streaming video captions directly, without necessitating additional training. In terms of efficiency, VideoLLaMB, trained on 16 frames, supports up to 320 frames on a single Nvidia A100 GPU with linear GPU memory scaling, ensuring both high performance and cost-effectiveness, thereby setting a new foundation for long-form video-language models in both academic and practical applications.

Title: DepthCrafter: Generating Consistent Long Depth Sequences for Open-world Videos
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02095
Summary: Despite significant advancements in monocular depth estimation for static images, estimating video depth in the open world remains challenging, since open-world videos are extremely diverse in content, motion, camera movement, and length. We present DepthCrafter, an innovative method for generating temporally consistent long depth sequences with intricate details for open-world videos, without requiring any supplementary information such as camera poses or optical flow. DepthCrafter achieves generalization ability to open-world videos by training a video-to-depth model from a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model, through our meticulously designed three-stage training strategy with the compiled paired video-depth datasets. Our training approach enables the model to generate depth sequences with variable lengths at one time, up to 110 frames, and harvest both precise depth details and rich content diversity from realistic and synthetic datasets. We also propose an inference strategy that processes extremely long videos through segment-wise estimation and seamless stitching. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets reveal that DepthCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-world video depth estimation under zero-shot settings. Furthermore, DepthCrafter facilitates various downstream applications, including depth-based visual effects and conditional video generation.

Title: OD-VAE: An Omni-dimensional Video Compressor for Improving Latent Video Diffusion Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01199
Summary: Variational Autoencoder (VAE), compressing videos into latent representations, is a crucial preceding component of Latent Video Diffusion Models (LVDMs). With the same reconstruction quality, the more sufficient the VAE's compression for videos is, the more efficient the LVDMs are. However, most LVDMs utilize 2D image VAE, whose compression for videos is only in the spatial dimension and often ignored in the temporal dimension. How to conduct temporal compression for videos in a VAE to obtain more concise latent representations while promising accurate reconstruction is seldom explored. To fill this gap, we propose an omni-dimension compression VAE, named OD-VAE, which can temporally and spatially compress videos. Although OD-VAE's more sufficient compression brings a great challenge to video reconstruction, it can still achieve high reconstructed accuracy by our fine design. To obtain a better trade-off between video reconstruction quality and compression speed, four variants of OD-VAE are introduced and analyzed. In addition, a novel tail initialization is designed to train OD-VAE more efficiently, and a novel inference strategy is proposed to enable OD-VAE to handle videos of arbitrary length with limited GPU memory. Comprehensive experiments on video reconstruction and LVDM-based video generation demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods.

Title: Compositional 3D-aware Video Generation with LLM Director
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00558
Summary: Significant progress has been made in text-to-video generation through the use of powerful generative models and large-scale internet data. However, substantial challenges remain in precisely controlling individual concepts within the generated video, such as the motion and appearance of specific characters and the movement of viewpoints. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm that generates each concept in 3D representation separately and then composes them with priors from Large Language Models (LLM) and 2D diffusion models. Specifically, given an input textual prompt, our scheme consists of three stages: 1) We leverage LLM as the director to first decompose the complex query into several sub-prompts that indicate individual concepts within the video~(e.g., scene, objects, motions), then we let LLM to invoke pre-trained expert models to obtain corresponding 3D representations of concepts. 2) To compose these representations, we prompt multi-modal LLM to produce coarse guidance on the scales and coordinates of trajectories for the objects. 3) To make the generated frames adhere to natural image distribution, we further leverage 2D diffusion priors and use Score Distillation Sampling to refine the composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-fidelity videos from text with diverse motion and flexible control over each concept. Project page: https://aka.ms/c3v.

Title: LinFusion: 1 GPU, 1 Minute, 16K Image
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02097
Summary: Modern diffusion models, particularly those utilizing a Transformer-based UNet for denoising, rely heavily on self-attention operations to manage complex spatial relationships, thus achieving impressive generation performance. However, this existing paradigm faces significant challenges in generating high-resolution visual content due to its quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the number of spatial tokens. To address this limitation, we aim at a novel linear attention mechanism as an alternative in this paper. Specifically, we begin our exploration from recently introduced models with linear complexity, e.g., Mamba, Mamba2, and Gated Linear Attention, and identify two key features-attention normalization and non-causal inference-that enhance high-resolution visual generation performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a generalized linear attention paradigm, which serves as a low-rank approximation of a wide spectrum of popular linear token mixers. To save the training cost and better leverage pre-trained models, we initialize our models and distill the knowledge from pre-trained StableDiffusion (SD). We find that the distilled model, termed LinFusion, achieves performance on par with or superior to the original SD after only modest training, while significantly reducing time and memory complexity. Extensive experiments on SD-v1.5, SD-v2.1, and SD-XL demonstrate that LinFusion delivers satisfactory zero-shot cross-resolution generation performance, generating high-resolution images like 16K resolution. Moreover, it is highly compatible with pre-trained SD components, such as ControlNet and IP-Adapter, requiring no adaptation efforts. Codes are available at https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion.

Title: LongRecipe: Recipe for Efficient Long Context Generalization in Large Languge Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00509
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in handling long-context tasks because of their limited effective context window size during pretraining, which restricts their ability to generalize over extended sequences. Meanwhile, extending the context window in LLMs through post-pretraining is highly resource-intensive. To address this, we introduce **LongRecipe**, an efficient training strategy for extending the context window of LLMs, including impactful token analysis, position index transformation, and training optimization strategies. It simulates long-sequence inputs while maintaining training efficiency and significantly improves the model's understanding of long-range dependencies. Experiments on three types of LLMs show that LongRecipe can utilize long sequences while requiring only 30% of the target context window size, and reduces computational training resource over 85% compared to full sequence training. Furthermore, LongRecipe also preserves the original LLM's capabilities in general tasks. Ultimately, *we can extend the effective context window of open-source LLMs from 8k to 128k, achieving performance close to GPT-4 with just one day of dedicated training using a single GPU with 80G memory.* Our code is released at the [link](https://github.com/zhiyuanhubj/LongRecipe).

Title: Density Adaptive Attention-based Speech Network: Enhancing Feature Understanding for Mental Health Disorders
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00391
Summary: Speech-based depression detection poses significant challenges for automated detection due to its unique manifestation across individuals and data scarcity. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DAAMAudioCNNLSTM and DAAMAudioTransformer, two parameter efficient and explainable models for audio feature extraction and depression detection. DAAMAudioCNNLSTM features a novel CNN-LSTM framework with multi-head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), focusing dynamically on informative speech segments. DAAMAudioTransformer, leveraging a transformer encoder in place of the CNN-LSTM architecture, incorporates the same DAAM module for enhanced attention and interpretability. These approaches not only enhance detection robustness and interpretability but also achieve state-of-the-art performance: DAAMAudioCNNLSTM with an F1 macro score of 0.702 and DAAMAudioTransformer with an F1 macro score of 0.72 on the DAIC-WOZ dataset, without reliance on supplementary information such as vowel positions and speaker information during training/validation as in previous approaches. Both models' significant explainability and efficiency in leveraging speech signals for depression detection represent a leap towards more reliable, clinically useful diagnostic tools, promising advancements in speech and mental health care. To foster further research in this domain, we make our code publicly available.

We pretrain it on 5 trillion tokens and further adapt it to create OLMoE-1B-7B-Instruct. Our models outperform all available models with similar active parameters, even surpassing larger ones like Llama2-13B-Chat and DeepSeekMoE-16B. We present various experiments on MoE training, analyze routing in our model showing high specialization, and open-source all aspects of our work: model weights, training data, code, and logs.

Summary: Recent advances in language models have achieved significant progress. GPT-4o, as a new milestone, has enabled real-time conversations with humans, demonstrating near-human natural fluency. Such human-computer interaction necessitates models with the capability to perform reasoning directly with the audio modality and generate output in streaming. However, this remains beyond the reach of current academic models, as they typically depend on extra TTS systems for speech synthesis, resulting in undesirable latency. This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. To achieve this capability, we propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. Our method also helps to retain the original model's language capabilities with minimal degradation, enabling other works to establish real-time interaction capabilities. We call this training method "Any Model Can Talk". We also introduce the VoiceAssistant-400K dataset to fine-tune models optimized for speech output. To our best knowledge, Mini-Omni is the first fully end-to-end, open-source model for real-time speech interaction, offering valuable potential for future research.

Title: VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17253
Summary: Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either fine-tune large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time-series datasets to develop TSF foundation models. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich and high-quality natural images, based on the intrinsic similarities between images and time series. To bridge the gap between the two domains, we reformulate the TSF task as an image reconstruction task, which is further processed by a visual masked autoencoder (MAE) self-supervised pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With minimal fine-tuning, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. These findings suggest that visual models could be a free lunch for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-domain research between computer vision and TSF. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.

Title: Iterative Graph Alignment
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16667
Summary: By compressing diverse narratives, LLMs go beyond memorization, achieving intelligence by capturing generalizable causal relationships. However, they suffer from local 'representation gaps' due to insufficient training data diversity, limiting their real-world utility, especially in tasks requiring strict alignment to rules. Traditional alignment methods relying on heavy human annotations are inefficient and unscalable. Recent self-alignment techniques also fall short, as they often depend on self-selection based prompting and memorization-based learning. To address these issues, we introduce Iterative Graph Alignment (IGA), an annotation-free rule-based alignment algorithm. A teacher model (VLM) employs Iterative Graph Prompting (IGP) to create logical graphs and reference answers. The student model (LLM) identifies local knowledge gaps by attempting to align its responses with these references, collaborating with helper models to generate diverse answers. These aligned responses are then used for iterative supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our evaluations across five rule-based scenarios demonstrate IGP's effectiveness, with a 73.12\% alignment improvement in Claude Sonnet 3.5, and Llama3-8B-Instruct achieving an 86.20\% improvement, outperforming Claude Sonnet 3.5 in rule-based alignment.

Title: VQ4DiT: Efficient Post-Training Vector Quantization for Diffusion Transformers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17131
Summary: The Diffusion Transformers Models (DiTs) have transitioned the network architecture from traditional UNets to transformers, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in image generation. Although DiTs have been widely applied to high-definition video generation tasks, their large parameter size hinders inference on edge devices. Vector quantization (VQ) can decompose model weight into a codebook and assignments, allowing extreme weight quantization and significantly reducing memory usage. In this paper, we propose VQ4DiT, a fast post-training vector quantization method for DiTs. We found that traditional VQ methods calibrate only the codebook without calibrating the assignments. This leads to weight sub-vectors being incorrectly assigned to the same assignment, providing inconsistent gradients to the codebook and resulting in a suboptimal result. To address this challenge, VQ4DiT calculates the candidate assignment set for each weight sub-vector based on Euclidean distance and reconstructs the sub-vector based on the weighted average. Then, using the zero-data and block-wise calibration method, the optimal assignment from the set is efficiently selected while calibrating the codebook. VQ4DiT quantizes a DiT XL/2 model on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within 20 minutes to 5 hours depending on the different quantization settings. Experiments show that VQ4DiT establishes a new state-of-the-art in model size and performance trade-offs, quantizing weights to 2-bit precision while retaining acceptable image generation quality.

Title: GIFT-SW: Gaussian noise Injected Fine-Tuning of Salient Weights for LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15300
Summary: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained popularity and democratized the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies have shown that a small subset of weights significantly impacts performance. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel PEFT method, called Gaussian noise Injected Fine Tuning of Salient Weights (GIFT-SW). Our method updates only salient columns, while injecting Gaussian noise into non-salient ones. To identify these columns, we developeda generalized sensitivity metric that extends and unifies metrics from previous studies. Experiments with LLaMA models demonstrate that GIFT-SW outperforms full fine-tuning and modern PEFT methods under the same computational budget. Moreover, GIFT-SW offers practical advantages to recover performance of models subjected to mixed-precision quantization with keeping salient weights in full precision.

Title: CrossViewDiff: A Cross-View Diffusion Model for Satellite-to-Street View Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14765
Summary: Satellite-to-street view synthesis aims at generating a realistic street-view image from its corresponding satellite-view image. Although stable diffusion models have exhibit remarkable performance in a variety of image generation applications, their reliance on similar-view inputs to control the generated structure or texture restricts their application to the challenging cross-view synthesis task. In this work, we propose CrossViewDiff, a cross-view diffusion model for satellite-to-street view synthesis. To address the challenges posed by the large discrepancy across views, we design the satellite scene structure estimation and cross-view texture mapping modules to construct the structural and textural controls for street-view image synthesis. We further design a cross-view control guided denoising process that incorporates the above controls via an enhanced cross-view attention module. To achieve a more comprehensive evaluation of the synthesis results, we additionally design a GPT-based scoring method as a supplement to standard evaluation metrics. We also explore the effect of different data sources (e.g., text, maps, building heights, and multi-temporal satellite imagery) on this task. Results on three public cross-view datasets show that CrossViewDiff outperforms current state-of-the-art on both standard and GPT-based evaluation metrics, generating high-quality street-view panoramas with more realistic structures and textures across rural, suburban, and urban scenes. The code and models of this work will be released at https://opendatalab.github.io/CrossViewDiff/.

Title: UrBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Multi-View Urban Scenarios
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17267
Summary: Recent evaluations of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have explored their capabilities in various domains, with only few benchmarks specifically focusing on urban environments. Moreover, existing urban benchmarks have been limited to evaluating LMMs with basic region-level urban tasks under singular views, leading to incomplete evaluations of LMMs' abilities in urban environments. To address these issues, we present UrBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating LMMs in complex multi-view urban scenarios. UrBench contains 11.6K meticulously curated questions at both region-level and role-level that cover 4 task dimensions: Geo-Localization, Scene Reasoning, Scene Understanding, and Object Understanding, totaling 14 task types. In constructing UrBench, we utilize data from existing datasets and additionally collect data from 11 cities, creating new annotations using a cross-view detection-matching method. With these images and annotations, we then integrate LMM-based, rule-based, and human-based methods to construct large-scale high-quality questions. Our evaluations on 21 LMMs show that current LMMs struggle in the urban environments in several aspects. Even the best performing GPT-4o lags behind humans in most tasks, ranging from simple tasks such as counting to complex tasks such as orientation, localization and object attribute recognition, with an average performance gap of 17.4%. Our benchmark also reveals that LMMs exhibit inconsistent behaviors with different urban views, especially with respect to understanding cross-view relations. UrBench datasets and benchmark results will be publicly available at https://opendatalab.github.io/UrBench/.

Title: InkubaLM: A small language model for low-resource African languages
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17024
Summary: High-resource language models often fall short in the African context, where there is a critical need for models that are efficient, accessible, and locally relevant, even amidst significant computing and data constraints. This paper introduces InkubaLM, a small language model with 0.4 billion parameters, which achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts and more extensive training data on tasks such as machine translation, question-answering, AfriMMLU, and the AfriXnli task. Notably, InkubaLM outperforms many larger models in sentiment analysis and demonstrates remarkable consistency across multiple languages. This work represents a pivotal advancement in challenging the conventional paradigm that effective language models must rely on substantial resources. Our model and datasets are publicly available \url{https://huggingface.co/lelapa} to encourage research and development on low-resource languages.

Title: Jina-ColBERT-v2: A General-Purpose Multilingual Late Interaction Retriever
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16672
Summary: Multi-vector dense models, such as ColBERT, have proven highly effective in information retrieval. ColBERT's late interaction scoring approximates the joint query-document attention seen in cross-encoders while maintaining inference efficiency closer to traditional dense retrieval models, thanks to its bi-encoder architecture and recent optimizations in indexing and search. In this paper, we introduce several improvements to the ColBERT model architecture and training pipeline, leveraging techniques successful in the more established single-vector embedding model paradigm, particularly those suited for heterogeneous multilingual data. Our new model, Jina-ColBERT-v2, demonstrates strong performance across a range of English and multilingual retrieval tasks, while also cutting storage requirements by up to 50% compared to previous models.

Title: Large-Scale Multi-omic Biosequence Transformers for Modeling Peptide-Nucleotide Interactions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16245
Summary: The transformer architecture has revolutionized bioinformatics and driven progress in the understanding and prediction of the properties of biomolecules. Almost all research on large-scale biosequence transformers has focused on one domain at a time (single-omic), usually nucleotides or peptides. These models have seen incredible success in downstream tasks in each domain and have achieved particularly noteworthy breakthroughs in sequences of peptides and structural modeling. However, these single-omic models are naturally incapable of modeling multi-omic tasks, one of the most biologically critical being nucleotide-peptide interactions.   We present our work training the first multi-omic nucleotide-peptide foundation models. We show that these multi-omic models (MOMs) can learn joint representations between various single-omic distributions that are emergently consistent with the Central Dogma of molecular biology, despite only being trained on unlabeled biosequences. We further demonstrate that MOMs can be fine-tuned to achieve state-of-the-art results on peptide-nucleotide interaction tasks, namely predicting the change in Gibbs free energy ({\Delta}G) of the binding interaction between a given oligonucleotide and peptide, as well as the effect on this binding interaction due to mutations in the oligonucleotide sequence ({\Delta}{\Delta}G).   Remarkably, we show that multi-omic biosequence transformers emergently learn useful structural information without any prior structural training, allowing us to predict which peptide residues are most involved in the peptide-nucleotide binding interaction. Lastly, we provide evidence that multi-omic biosequence models are non-inferior to foundation models trained on single-omics distributions, suggesting a more generalized or foundational approach to building these models.

Title: Automatic Differential Diagnosis using Transformer-Based Multi-Label Sequence Classification
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15827
Summary: As the field of artificial intelligence progresses, assistive technologies are becoming more widely used across all industries. The healthcare industry is no different, with numerous studies being done to develop assistive tools for healthcare professionals. Automatic diagnostic systems are one such beneficial tool that can assist with a variety of tasks, including collecting patient information, analyzing test results, and diagnosing patients. However, the idea of developing systems that can provide a differential diagnosis has been largely overlooked in most of these research studies. In this study, we propose a transformer-based approach for providing differential diagnoses based on a patient's age, sex, medical history, and symptoms. We use the DDXPlus dataset, which provides differential diagnosis information for patients based on 49 disease types. Firstly, we propose a method to process the tabular patient data from the dataset and engineer them into patient reports to make them suitable for our research. In addition, we introduce two data modification modules to diversify the training data and consequently improve the robustness of the models. We approach the task as a multi-label classification problem and conduct extensive experiments using four transformer models. All the models displayed promising results by achieving over 97% F1 score on the held-out test set. Moreover, we design additional behavioral tests to get a broader understanding of the models. In particular, for one of our test cases, we prepared a custom test set of 100 samples with the assistance of a doctor. The results on the custom set showed that our proposed data modification modules improved the model's generalization capabilities. We hope our findings will provide future researchers with valuable insights and inspire them to develop reliable systems for automatic differential diagnosis.

Title: VLM4Bio: A Benchmark Dataset to Evaluate Pretrained Vision-Language Models for Trait Discovery from Biological Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16176
Summary: Images are increasingly becoming the currency for documenting biodiversity on the planet, providing novel opportunities for accelerating scientific discoveries in the field of organismal biology, especially with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). We ask if pre-trained VLMs can aid scientists in answering a range of biologically relevant questions without any additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs in the field of organismal biology using a novel dataset, VLM4Bio, consisting of 469K question-answer pairs involving 30K images from three groups of organisms: fishes, birds, and butterflies, covering five biologically relevant tasks. We also explore the effects of applying prompting techniques and tests for reasoning hallucination on the performance of VLMs, shedding new light on the capabilities of current SOTA VLMs in answering biologically relevant questions using images. The code and datasets for running all the analyses reported in this paper can be found at https://github.com/sammarfy/VLM4Bio.

Title: SciLitLLM: How to Adapt LLMs for Scientific Literature Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15545
Summary: Scientific literature understanding is crucial for extracting targeted information and garnering insights, thereby significantly advancing scientific discovery. Despite the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs), they face challenges in scientific literature understanding, primarily due to (1) a lack of scientific knowledge and (2) unfamiliarity with specialized scientific tasks.   To develop an LLM specialized in scientific literature understanding, we propose a hybrid strategy that integrates continual pre-training (CPT) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to simultaneously infuse scientific domain knowledge and enhance instruction-following capabilities for domain-specific tasks.cIn this process, we identify two key challenges: (1) constructing high-quality CPT corpora, and (2) generating diverse SFT instructions. We address these challenges through a meticulous pipeline, including PDF text extraction, parsing content error correction, quality filtering, and synthetic instruction creation. Applying this strategy, we present a suite of LLMs: SciLitLLM, specialized in scientific literature understanding. These models demonstrate promising performance on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.   Our contributions are threefold: (1) We present an effective framework that integrates CPT and SFT to adapt LLMs to scientific literature understanding, which can also be easily adapted to other domains. (2) We propose an LLM-based synthesis method to generate diverse and high-quality scientific instructions, resulting in a new instruction set -- SciLitIns -- for supervised fine-tuning in less-represented scientific domains. (3) SciLitLLM achieves promising performance improvements on scientific literature understanding benchmarks.

Title: ClimDetect: A Benchmark Dataset for Climate Change Detection and Attribution
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15993
Summary: Detecting and attributing temperature increases due to climate change is crucial for understanding global warming and guiding adaptation strategies. The complexity of distinguishing human-induced climate signals from natural variability has challenged traditional detection and attribution (D&A) approaches, which seek to identify specific "fingerprints" in climate response variables. Deep learning offers potential for discerning these complex patterns in expansive spatial datasets. However, lack of standard protocols has hindered consistent comparisons across studies. We introduce ClimDetect, a standardized dataset of over 816k daily climate snapshots, designed to enhance model accuracy in identifying climate change signals. ClimDetect integrates various input and target variables used in past research, ensuring comparability and consistency. We also explore the application of vision transformers (ViT) to climate data, a novel and modernizing approach in this context. Our open-access data and code serve as a benchmark for advancing climate science through improved model evaluations. ClimDetect is publicly accessible via Huggingface dataet respository at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ClimDetect/ClimDetect.

Title: CoRe: Context-Regularized Text Embedding Learning for Text-to-Image Personalization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15914
Summary: Recent advances in text-to-image personalization have enabled high-quality and controllable image synthesis for user-provided concepts. However, existing methods still struggle to balance identity preservation with text alignment. Our approach is based on the fact that generating prompt-aligned images requires a precise semantic understanding of the prompt, which involves accurately processing the interactions between the new concept and its surrounding context tokens within the CLIP text encoder. To address this, we aim to embed the new concept properly into the input embedding space of the text encoder, allowing for seamless integration with existing tokens. We introduce Context Regularization (CoRe), which enhances the learning of the new concept's text embedding by regularizing its context tokens in the prompt. This is based on the insight that appropriate output vectors of the text encoder for the context tokens can only be achieved if the new concept's text embedding is correctly learned. CoRe can be applied to arbitrary prompts without requiring the generation of corresponding images, thus improving the generalization of the learned text embedding. Additionally, CoRe can serve as a test-time optimization technique to further enhance the generations for specific prompts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms several baseline methods in both identity preservation and text alignment. Code will be made publicly available.

Title: The VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge: A Retrospective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14886
Summary: The VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenges (VoxSRC) were a series of challenges and workshops that ran annually from 2019 to 2023. The challenges primarily evaluated the tasks of speaker recognition and diarisation under various settings including: closed and open training data; as well as supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised training for domain adaptation. The challenges also provided publicly available training and evaluation datasets for each task and setting, with new test sets released each year. In this paper, we provide a review of these challenges that covers: what they explored; the methods developed by the challenge participants and how these evolved; and also the current state of the field for speaker verification and diarisation. We chart the progress in performance over the five installments of the challenge on a common evaluation dataset and provide a detailed analysis of how each year's special focus affected participants' performance. This paper is aimed both at researchers who want an overview of the speaker recognition and diarisation field, and also at challenge organisers who want to benefit from the successes and avoid the mistakes of the VoxSRC challenges. We end with a discussion of the current strengths of the field and open challenges. Project page : https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/datasets/voxceleb/voxsrc/workshop.html

Title: CURLoRA: Stable LLM Continual Fine-Tuning and Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14572
Summary: This paper introduces CURLoRA, a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that leverages CUR matrix decomposition in the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our method addresses two critical challenges in LLM fine-tuning: mitigating catastrophic forgetting during continual learning and reducing the number of trainable parameters. We propose a unique modification to the CUR decomposition process, utilizing inverted probabilities for column and row selection which acts as an implicit regularization, and initializing the U matrix as a zero matrix, and only fine-tuning it. We demonstrate through experiments on multiple datasets that CURLoRA outperforms standard LoRA in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. It maintains model stability and performance across tasks while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Our results show that CURLoRA achieves very good and stable task accuracy while maintaining base model's perplexity scores fixed compared to LoRA upon continual fine-tuning, particularly in scenarios with limited data.

Title: Physics of Language Models: Part 2.2, How to Learn From Mistakes on Grade-School Math Problems
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16293
Summary: Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving reasoning tasks; however, even the strongest models still occasionally make reasoning mistakes. Recently, there has been active research aimed at improving reasoning accuracy, particularly by using pretrained language models to "self-correct" their mistakes via multi-round prompting. In this paper, we follow this line of work but focus on understanding the usefulness of incorporating "error-correction" data directly into the pretraining stage. This data consists of erroneous solution steps immediately followed by their corrections. Using a synthetic math dataset, we show promising results: this type of pretrain data can help language models achieve higher reasoning accuracy directly (i.e., through simple auto-regression, without multi-round prompting) compared to pretraining on the same amount of error-free data. We also delve into many details, such as (1) how this approach differs from beam search, (2) how such data can be prepared, (3) whether masking is needed on the erroneous tokens, (4) the amount of error required, (5) whether such data can be deferred to the fine-tuning stage, and many others.

Title: Meta Flow Matching: Integrating Vector Fields on the Wasserstein Manifold
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14608
Summary: Numerous biological and physical processes can be modeled as systems of interacting entities evolving continuously over time, e.g. the dynamics of communicating cells or physical particles. Learning the dynamics of such systems is essential for predicting the temporal evolution of populations across novel samples and unseen environments. Flow-based models allow for learning these dynamics at the population level - they model the evolution of the entire distribution of samples. However, current flow-based models are limited to a single initial population and a set of predefined conditions which describe different dynamics. We argue that multiple processes in natural sciences have to be represented as vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold of probability densities. That is, the change of the population at any moment in time depends on the population itself due to the interactions between samples. In particular, this is crucial for personalized medicine where the development of diseases and their respective treatment response depends on the microenvironment of cells specific to each patient. We propose Meta Flow Matching (MFM), a practical approach to integrating along these vector fields on the Wasserstein manifold by amortizing the flow model over the initial populations. Namely, we embed the population of samples using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and use these embeddings to train a Flow Matching model. This gives MFM the ability to generalize over the initial distributions unlike previously proposed methods. We demonstrate the ability of MFM to improve prediction of individual treatment responses on a large scale multi-patient single-cell drug screen dataset.

Title: StyleRemix: Interpretable Authorship Obfuscation via Distillation and Perturbation of Style Elements
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15666
Summary: Authorship obfuscation, rewriting a text to intentionally obscure the identity of the author, is an important but challenging task. Current methods using large language models (LLMs) lack interpretability and controllability, often ignoring author-specific stylistic features, resulting in less robust performance overall.   To address this, we develop StyleRemix, an adaptive and interpretable obfuscation method that perturbs specific, fine-grained style elements of the original input text. StyleRemix uses pre-trained Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to rewrite an input specifically along various stylistic axes (e.g., formality and length) while maintaining low computational cost. StyleRemix outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and much larger LLMs in a variety of domains as assessed by both automatic and human evaluation.   Additionally, we release AuthorMix, a large set of 30K high-quality, long-form texts from a diverse set of 14 authors and 4 domains, and DiSC, a parallel corpus of 1,500 texts spanning seven style axes in 16 unique directions

Title: WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16532
Summary: Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.

Title: SAM2Point: Segment Any 3D as Videos in Zero-shot and Promptable Manners
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.16768
Summary: We introduce SAM2Point, a preliminary exploration adapting Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for zero-shot and promptable 3D segmentation. SAM2Point interprets any 3D data as a series of multi-directional videos, and leverages SAM 2 for 3D-space segmentation, without further training or 2D-3D projection. Our framework supports various prompt types, including 3D points, boxes, and masks, and can generalize across diverse scenarios, such as 3D objects, indoor scenes, outdoor environments, and raw sparse LiDAR. Demonstrations on multiple 3D datasets, e.g., Objaverse, S3DIS, ScanNet, Semantic3D, and KITTI, highlight the robust generalization capabilities of SAM2Point. To our best knowledge, we present the most faithful implementation of SAM in 3D, which may serve as a starting point for future research in promptable 3D segmentation.
