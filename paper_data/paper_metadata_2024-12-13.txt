Title: Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06016
Summary: While recent foundational video generators produce visually rich output, they still struggle with appearance drift, where objects gradually degrade or change inconsistently across frames, breaking visual coherence. We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation. Project page: hyeonho99.github.io/track4gen

Title: The BrowserGym Ecosystem for Web Agent Research
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05467
Summary: The BrowserGym ecosystem addresses the growing need for efficient evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging automation and Large Language Models (LLMs) for web interaction tasks. Many existing benchmarks suffer from fragmentation and inconsistent evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to achieve reliable comparisons and reproducible results. BrowserGym aims to solve this by providing a unified, gym-like environment with well-defined observation and action spaces, facilitating standardized evaluation across diverse benchmarks. Combined with AgentLab, a complementary framework that aids in agent creation, testing, and analysis, BrowserGym offers flexibility for integrating new benchmarks while ensuring consistent evaluation and comprehensive experiment management. This standardized approach seeks to reduce the time and complexity of developing web agents, supporting more reliable comparisons and facilitating in-depth analysis of agent behaviors, and could result in more adaptable, capable agents, ultimately accelerating innovation in LLM-driven automation. As a supporting evidence, we conduct the first large-scale, multi-benchmark web agent experiment and compare the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across all benchmarks currently available in BrowserGym. Among other findings, our results highlight a large discrepancy between OpenAI and Anthropic's latests models, with Claude-3.5-Sonnet leading the way on almost all benchmarks, except on vision-related tasks where GPT-4o is superior. Despite these advancements, our results emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, due to the inherent complexity of real-world web environments and the limitations of current models.

Title: I Don't Know: Explicit Modeling of Uncertainty with an [IDK] Token
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06676
Summary: Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we propose a novel calibration method that can be used to combat hallucinations. We add a special [IDK] ("I don't know") token to the model's vocabulary and introduce an objective function that shifts probability mass to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions. This approach allows the model to express uncertainty in its output explicitly. We evaluate our proposed method across multiple model architectures and factual downstream tasks. We find that models trained with our method are able to express uncertainty in places where they would previously make mistakes while suffering only a small loss of encoded knowledge. We further perform extensive ablation studies of multiple variations of our approach and provide a detailed analysis of the precision-recall tradeoff of our method.

Title: Bootstrapping Language-Guided Navigation Learning with Self-Refining Data Flywheel
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08467
Summary: Creating high-quality data for training robust language-instructed agents is a long-lasting challenge in embodied AI. In this paper, we introduce a Self-Refining Data Flywheel (SRDF) that generates high-quality and large-scale navigational instruction-trajectory pairs by iteratively refining the data pool through the collaboration between two models, the instruction generator and the navigator, without any human-in-the-loop annotation. Specifically, SRDF starts with using a base generator to create an initial data pool for training a base navigator, followed by applying the trained navigator to filter the data pool. This leads to higher-fidelity data to train a better generator, which can, in turn, produce higher-quality data for training the next-round navigator. Such a flywheel establishes a data self-refining process, yielding a continuously improved and highly effective dataset for large-scale language-guided navigation learning. Our experiments demonstrate that after several flywheel rounds, the navigator elevates the performance boundary from 70% to 78% SPL on the classic R2R test set, surpassing human performance (76%) for the first time. Meanwhile, this process results in a superior generator, evidenced by a SPICE increase from 23.5 to 26.2, better than all previous VLN instruction generation methods. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method through increasing environment and instruction diversity, and the generalization ability of our pre-trained navigator across various downstream navigation tasks, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in all cases.

Title: KaSA: Knowledge-Aware Singular-Value Adaptation of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06071
Summary: The increasing sizes of large language models (LLMs) result in significant computational overhead and memory usage when adapting these models to specific tasks or domains. Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality. To address this limitation, we introduce Knowledge-aware Singular-value Adaptation (KaSA), a PEFT method that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) with knowledge-aware singular values to dynamically activate knowledge based on its relevance to the task at hand. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that KaSA consistently outperforms FFT and 14 popular PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and 4 synthetic datasets, underscoring our method's efficacy and adaptability. The source code of our method is available at https://github.com/juyongjiang/KaSA.

Title: StyleStudio: Text-Driven Style Transfer with Selective Control of Style Elements
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08503
Summary: Text-driven style transfer aims to merge the style of a reference image with content described by a text prompt. Recent advancements in text-to-image models have improved the nuance of style transformations, yet significant challenges remain, particularly with overfitting to reference styles, limiting stylistic control, and misaligning with textual content. In this paper, we propose three complementary strategies to address these issues. First, we introduce a cross-modal Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) mechanism for better integration of style and text features, enhancing alignment. Second, we develop a Style-based Classifier-Free Guidance (SCFG) approach that enables selective control over stylistic elements, reducing irrelevant influences. Finally, we incorporate a teacher model during early generation stages to stabilize spatial layouts and mitigate artifacts. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in style transfer quality and alignment with textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach can be integrated into existing style transfer frameworks without fine-tuning.

Title: FlowEdit: Inversion-Free Text-Based Editing Using Pre-Trained Flow Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08629
Summary: Editing real images using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion/flow model often involves inverting the image into its corresponding noise map. However, inversion by itself is typically insufficient for obtaining satisfactory results, and therefore many methods additionally intervene in the sampling process. Such methods achieve improved results but are not seamlessly transferable between model architectures. Here, we introduce FlowEdit, a text-based editing method for pre-trained T2I flow models, which is inversion-free, optimization-free and model agnostic. Our method constructs an ODE that directly maps between the source and target distributions (corresponding to the source and target text prompts) and achieves a lower transport cost than the inversion approach. This leads to state-of-the-art results, as we illustrate with Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX. Code and examples are available on the project's webpage.

Title: MIT-10M: A Large Scale Parallel Corpus of Multilingual Image Translation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07147
Summary: Image Translation (IT) holds immense potential across diverse domains, enabling the translation of textual content within images into various languages. However, existing datasets often suffer from limitations in scale, diversity, and quality, hindering the development and evaluation of IT models. To address this issue, we introduce MIT-10M, a large-scale parallel corpus of multilingual image translation with over 10M image-text pairs derived from real-world data, which has undergone extensive data cleaning and multilingual translation validation. It contains 840K images in three sizes, 28 categories, tasks with three levels of difficulty and 14 languages image-text pairs, which is a considerable improvement on existing datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate and train models on MIT-10M. The experimental results clearly indicate that our dataset has higher adaptability when it comes to evaluating the performance of the models in tackling challenging and complex image translation tasks in the real world. Moreover, the performance of the model fine-tuned with MIT-10M has tripled compared to the baseline model, further confirming its superiority.

Title: Learning Flow Fields in Attention for Controllable Person Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08486
Summary: Controllable person image generation aims to generate a person image conditioned on reference images, allowing precise control over the person's appearance or pose. However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models.

Title: StreamChat: Chatting with Streaming Video
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08646
Summary: This paper presents StreamChat, a novel approach that enhances the interaction capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with streaming video content. In streaming interaction scenarios, existing methods rely solely on visual information available at the moment a question is posed, resulting in significant delays as the model remains unaware of subsequent changes in the streaming video. StreamChat addresses this limitation by innovatively updating the visual context at each decoding step, ensuring that the model utilizes up-to-date video content throughout the decoding process. Additionally, we introduce a flexible and efficient crossattention-based architecture to process dynamic streaming inputs while maintaining inference efficiency for streaming interactions. Furthermore, we construct a new dense instruction dataset to facilitate the training of streaming interaction models, complemented by a parallel 3D-RoPE mechanism that encodes the relative temporal information of visual and text tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamChat achieves competitive performance on established image and video benchmarks and exhibits superior capabilities in streaming interaction scenarios compared to state-of-the-art video LMM.

Title: StyleMaster: Stylize Your Video with Artistic Generation and Translation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07744
Summary: Style control has been popular in video generation models. Existing methods often generate videos far from the given style, cause content leakage, and struggle to transfer one video to the desired style. Our first observation is that the style extraction stage matters, whereas existing methods emphasize global style but ignore local textures. In order to bring texture features while preventing content leakage, we filter content-related patches while retaining style ones based on prompt-patch similarity; for global style extraction, we generate a paired style dataset through model illusion to facilitate contrastive learning, which greatly enhances the absolute style consistency. Moreover, to fill in the image-to-video gap, we train a lightweight motion adapter on still videos, which implicitly enhances stylization extent, and enables our image-trained model to be seamlessly applied to videos. Benefited from these efforts, our approach, StyleMaster, not only achieves significant improvement in both style resemblance and temporal coherence, but also can easily generalize to video style transfer with a gray tile ControlNet. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that StyleMaster significantly outperforms competitors, effectively generating high-quality stylized videos that align with textual content and closely resemble the style of reference images.

Title: POINTS1.5: Building a Vision-Language Model towards Real World Applications
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08443
Summary: Vision-language models have made significant strides recently, demonstrating superior performance across a range of tasks, e.g. optical character recognition and complex diagram analysis. Building on this trend, we introduce a new vision-language model, POINTS1.5, designed to excel in various real-world applications. POINTS1.5 is an enhancement of POINTS1.0 and incorporates several key innovations: i) We replace the original CLIP vision encoder, which had a fixed image resolution, with a NaViT-style vision encoder that supports native dynamic high resolution. This allows POINTS1.5 to process images of any resolution without needing to split them into tiles. ii) We add bilingual support to POINTS1.5, significantly enhancing its capability in Chinese. Due to the scarcity of open-source Chinese datasets for vision-language models, we collect numerous images from the Internet and annotate them using a combination of manual and automatic methods. iii) We propose a set of rigorous filtering methods for visual instruction tuning datasets. We comprehensively evaluate all these filtering methods, and choose the most effective ones to obtain the final visual instruction tuning set. Thanks to these innovations, POINTS1.5 significantly outperforms POINTS1.0 and demonstrates strong performance across a range of real-world applications. Notably, POINTS1.5-7B is trained on fewer than 4 billion tokens and ranks first on the OpenCompass leaderboard among models with fewer than 10 billion parameters

Title: Generative Densification: Learning to Densify Gaussians for High-Fidelity Generalizable 3D Reconstruction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06234
Summary: Generalized feed-forward Gaussian models have achieved significant progress in sparse-view 3D reconstruction by leveraging prior knowledge from large multi-view datasets. However, these models often struggle to represent high-frequency details due to the limited number of Gaussians. While the densification strategy used in per-scene 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) optimization can be adapted to the feed-forward models, it may not be ideally suited for generalized scenarios. In this paper, we propose Generative Densification, an efficient and generalizable method to densify Gaussians generated by feed-forward models. Unlike the 3D-GS densification strategy, which iteratively splits and clones raw Gaussian parameters, our method up-samples feature representations from the feed-forward models and generates their corresponding fine Gaussians in a single forward pass, leveraging the embedded prior knowledge for enhanced generalization. Experimental results on both object-level and scene-level reconstruction tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with comparable or smaller model sizes, achieving notable improvements in representing fine details.

Title: 3DSRBench: A Comprehensive 3D Spatial Reasoning Benchmark
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07825
Summary: 3D spatial reasoning is the ability to analyze and interpret the positions, orientations, and spatial relationships of objects within the 3D space. This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities. Our project page and dataset is available https://3dsrbench.github.io.

Title: LAION-SG: An Enhanced Large-Scale Dataset for Training Complex Image-Text Models with Structural Annotations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08580
Summary: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have shown remarkable success in producing high-quality images from text. However, existing T2I models show decayed performance in compositional image generation involving multiple objects and intricate relationships. We attribute this problem to limitations in existing datasets of image-text pairs, which lack precise inter-object relationship annotations with prompts only. To address this problem, we construct LAION-SG, a large-scale dataset with high-quality structural annotations of scene graphs (SG), which precisely describe attributes and relationships of multiple objects, effectively representing the semantic structure in complex scenes. Based on LAION-SG, we train a new foundation model SDXL-SG to incorporate structural annotation information into the generation process. Extensive experiments show advanced models trained on our LAION-SG boast significant performance improvements in complex scene generation over models on existing datasets. We also introduce CompSG-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates models on compositional image generation, establishing a new standard for this domain.

Title: SynCamMaster: Synchronizing Multi-Camera Video Generation from Diverse Viewpoints
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07760
Summary: Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown exceptional abilities in simulating real-world dynamics and maintaining 3D consistency. This progress inspires us to investigate the potential of these models to ensure dynamic consistency across various viewpoints, a highly desirable feature for applications such as virtual filming. Unlike existing methods focused on multi-view generation of single objects for 4D reconstruction, our interest lies in generating open-world videos from arbitrary viewpoints, incorporating 6 DoF camera poses. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play module that enhances a pre-trained text-to-video model for multi-camera video generation, ensuring consistent content across different viewpoints. Specifically, we introduce a multi-view synchronization module to maintain appearance and geometry consistency across these viewpoints. Given the scarcity of high-quality training data, we design a hybrid training scheme that leverages multi-camera images and monocular videos to supplement Unreal Engine-rendered multi-camera videos. Furthermore, our method enables intriguing extensions, such as re-rendering a video from novel viewpoints. We also release a multi-view synchronized video dataset, named SynCamVideo-Dataset.

Title: Mogo: RQ Hierarchical Causal Transformer for High-Quality 3D Human Motion Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07797
Summary: In the field of text-to-motion generation, Bert-type Masked Models (MoMask, MMM) currently produce higher-quality outputs compared to GPT-type autoregressive models (T2M-GPT). However, these Bert-type models often lack the streaming output capability required for applications in video game and multimedia environments, a feature inherent to GPT-type models. Additionally, they demonstrate weaker performance in out-of-distribution generation. To surpass the quality of BERT-type models while leveraging a GPT-type structure, without adding extra refinement models that complicate scaling data, we propose a novel architecture, Mogo (Motion Only Generate Once), which generates high-quality lifelike 3D human motions by training a single transformer model. Mogo consists of only two main components: 1) RVQ-VAE, a hierarchical residual vector quantization variational autoencoder, which discretizes continuous motion sequences with high precision; 2) Hierarchical Causal Transformer, responsible for generating the base motion sequences in an autoregressive manner while simultaneously inferring residuals across different layers. Experimental results demonstrate that Mogo can generate continuous and cyclic motion sequences up to 260 frames (13 seconds), surpassing the 196 frames (10 seconds) length limitation of existing datasets like HumanML3D. On the HumanML3D test set, Mogo achieves a FID score of 0.079, outperforming both the GPT-type model T2M-GPT (FID = 0.116), AttT2M (FID = 0.112) and the BERT-type model MMM (FID = 0.080). Furthermore, our model achieves the best quantitative performance in out-of-distribution generation.

Title: ACDiT: Interpolating Autoregressive Conditional Modeling and Diffusion Transformer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07720
Summary: The recent surge of interest in comprehensive multimodal models has necessitated the unification of diverse modalities. However, the unification suffers from disparate methodologies. Continuous visual generation necessitates the full-sequence diffusion-based approach, despite its divergence from the autoregressive modeling in the text domain. We posit that autoregressive modeling, i.e., predicting the future based on past deterministic experience, remains crucial in developing both a visual generation model and a potential unified multimodal model. In this paper, we explore an interpolation between the autoregressive modeling and full-parameters diffusion to model visual information. At its core, we present ACDiT, an Autoregressive blockwise Conditional Diffusion Transformer, where the block size of diffusion, i.e., the size of autoregressive units, can be flexibly adjusted to interpolate between token-wise autoregression and full-sequence diffusion. ACDiT is easy to implement, as simple as creating a Skip-Causal Attention Mask (SCAM) during training. During inference, the process iterates between diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding that can make full use of KV-Cache. We verify the effectiveness of ACDiT on image and video generation tasks. We also demonstrate that benefitted from autoregressive modeling, ACDiT can be seamlessly used in visual understanding tasks despite being trained on the diffusion objective. The analysis of the trade-off between autoregressive modeling and diffusion demonstrates the potential of ACDiT to be used in long-horizon visual generation tasks. These strengths make it promising as the backbone of future unified models.

Title: GraPE: A Generate-Plan-Edit Framework for Compositional T2I Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06089
Summary: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant progress with diffusion models, enabling generation of photo-realistic images from text prompts. Despite this progress, existing methods still face challenges in following complex text prompts, especially those requiring compositional and multi-step reasoning. Given such complex instructions, SOTA models often make mistakes in faithfully modeling object attributes, and relationships among them. In this work, we present an alternate paradigm for T2I synthesis, decomposing the task of complex multi-step generation into three steps, (a) Generate: we first generate an image using existing diffusion models (b) Plan: we make use of Multi-Modal LLMs (MLLMs) to identify the mistakes in the generated image expressed in terms of individual objects and their properties, and produce a sequence of corrective steps required in the form of an edit-plan. (c) Edit: we make use of an existing text-guided image editing models to sequentially execute our edit-plan over the generated image to get the desired image which is faithful to the original instruction. Our approach derives its strength from the fact that it is modular in nature, is training free, and can be applied over any combination of image generation and editing models. As an added contribution, we also develop a model capable of compositional editing, which further helps improve the overall accuracy of our proposed approach. Our method flexibly trades inference time compute with performance on compositional text prompts. We perform extensive experimental evaluation across 3 benchmarks and 10 T2I models including DALLE-3 and the latest -- SD-3.5-Large. Our approach not only improves the performance of the SOTA models, by upto 3 points, it also reduces the performance gap between weaker and stronger models. https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/{https://dair-iitd.github.io/GraPE/}

Title: HARP: Hesitation-Aware Reframing in Transformer Inference Pass
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07282
Summary: This paper aims to improve the performance of large language models by addressing the variable computational demands in inference steps, where some tokens require more computational resources than others. We present HARP, a simple modification to "off-the-shelf" Transformer forward pass. Drawing from hesitation and the framing effect in decision-making, HARP selectively applies additional computation when the model encounters uncertainty during token generation. Our method mimics human cognitive processes by pausing at difficult decision points and reframing inputs for a different perspective. Unlike other approaches, HARP is model-agnostic, training-free, and easy to implement. We thoroughly evaluate our method across various downstream tasks and model sizes, demonstrating performance improvements up to +5.16%. Notably, HARP achieves these gains while maintaining inference times twice faster than beam search. Simple and yet with significant gains, HARP offers a practical solution for enhancing the performance of Transformer-based language models with minimal computational impact.

Title: Mobile Video Diffusion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07583
Summary: Video diffusion models have achieved impressive realism and controllability but are limited by high computational demands, restricting their use on mobile devices. This paper introduces the first mobile-optimized video diffusion model. Starting from a spatio-temporal UNet from Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), we reduce memory and computational cost by reducing the frame resolution, incorporating multi-scale temporal representations, and introducing two novel pruning schema to reduce the number of channels and temporal blocks. Furthermore, we employ adversarial finetuning to reduce the denoising to a single step. Our model, coined as MobileVD, is 523x more efficient (1817.2 vs. 4.34 TFLOPs) with a slight quality drop (FVD 149 vs. 171), generating latents for a 14x512x256 px clip in 1.7 seconds on a Xiaomi-14 Pro.

Title: MoViE: Mobile Diffusion for Video Editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06578
Summary: Recent progress in diffusion-based video editing has shown remarkable potential for practical applications. However, these methods remain prohibitively expensive and challenging to deploy on mobile devices. In this study, we introduce a series of optimizations that render mobile video editing feasible. Building upon the existing image editing model, we first optimize its architecture and incorporate a lightweight autoencoder. Subsequently, we extend classifier-free guidance distillation to multiple modalities, resulting in a threefold on-device speedup. Finally, we reduce the number of sampling steps to one by introducing a novel adversarial distillation scheme which preserves the controllability of the editing process. Collectively, these optimizations enable video editing at 12 frames per second on mobile devices, while maintaining high quality. Our results are available at https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mobile-video-editing/

Title: LoRA.rar: Learning to Merge LoRAs via Hypernetworks for Subject-Style Conditioned Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05148
Summary: Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled personalized image creation with both user-defined subjects (content) and styles. Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adaptation parameters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA.rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over 4000times in the merging process. LoRA.rar pre-trains a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLM) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.

Title: Contextualized Counterspeech: Strategies for Adaptation, Personalization, and Evaluation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07338
Summary: AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct an LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation.

Title: OmniDocBench: Benchmarking Diverse PDF Document Parsing with Comprehensive Annotations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07626
Summary: Document content extraction is crucial in computer vision, especially for meeting the high-quality data needs of large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies. However, current document parsing methods suffer from significant limitations in terms of diversity and comprehensive evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniDocBench, a novel multi-source benchmark designed to advance automated document content extraction. OmniDocBench includes a meticulously curated and annotated high-quality evaluation dataset comprising nine diverse document types, such as academic papers, textbooks, slides, among others. Our benchmark provides a flexible and comprehensive evaluation framework with 19 layout category labels and 14 attribute labels, enabling multi-level assessments across entire datasets, individual modules, or specific data types. Using OmniDocBench, we perform an exhaustive comparative analysis of existing modular pipelines and multimodal end-to-end methods, highlighting their limitations in handling document diversity and ensuring fair evaluation. OmniDocBench establishes a robust, diverse, and fair evaluation standard for the document content extraction field, offering crucial insights for future advancements and fostering the development of document parsing technologies. The codes and dataset is available in https://github.com/opendatalab/OmniDocBench.

Title: 3DTrajMaster: Mastering 3D Trajectory for Multi-Entity Motion in Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07759
Summary: This paper aims to manipulate multi-entity 3D motions in video generation. Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Title: Maximizing Alignment with Minimal Feedback: Efficiently Learning Rewards for Visuomotor Robot Policy Alignment
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04835
Summary: Visuomotor robot policies, increasingly pre-trained on large-scale datasets, promise significant advancements across robotics domains. However, aligning these policies with end-user preferences remains a challenge, particularly when the preferences are hard to specify. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in non-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same success in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human feedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation, we propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an observation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less human preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback on fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual representation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching in this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation experiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation, demonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more efficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments. Finally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for three object manipulation tasks. We find that RAPL can fine-tune these policies with 5x less real human preference data, taking the first step towards minimizing human feedback while maximizing visuomotor robot policy alignment.

Title: Chimera: Improving Generalist Model with Domain-Specific Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05983
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) underscore the importance of scaling by increasing image-text paired data, achieving impressive performance on general tasks. Despite their effectiveness in broad applications, generalist models are primarily trained on web-scale datasets dominated by natural images, resulting in the sacrifice of specialized capabilities for domain-specific tasks that require extensive domain prior knowledge. Moreover, directly integrating expert models tailored for specific domains is challenging due to the representational gap and imbalanced optimization between the generalist model and experts. To address these challenges, we introduce Chimera, a scalable and low-cost multi-modal pipeline designed to boost the ability of existing LMMs with domain-specific experts. Specifically, we design a progressive training strategy to integrate features from expert models into the input of a generalist LMM. To address the imbalanced optimization caused by the well-aligned general visual encoder, we introduce a novel Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism. This results in a versatile model that excels across the chart, table, math, and document domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal reasoning and visual content extraction tasks, both of which are challenging tasks for assessing existing LMMs.

Title: Frame Representation Hypothesis: Multi-Token LLM Interpretability and Concept-Guided Text Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07334
Summary: Interpretability is a key challenge in fostering trust for Large Language Models (LLMs), which stems from the complexity of extracting reasoning from model's parameters. We present the Frame Representation Hypothesis, a theoretically robust framework grounded in the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) to interpret and control LLMs by modeling multi-token words. Prior research explored LRH to connect LLM representations with linguistic concepts, but was limited to single token analysis. As most words are composed of several tokens, we extend LRH to multi-token words, thereby enabling usage on any textual data with thousands of concepts. To this end, we propose words can be interpreted as frames, ordered sequences of vectors that better capture token-word relationships. Then, concepts can be represented as the average of word frames sharing a common concept. We showcase these tools through Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding, which can intuitively steer text generation using concepts of choice. We verify said ideas on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Phi 3 families, demonstrating gender and language biases, exposing harmful content, but also potential to remediate them, leading to safer and more transparent LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/phvv-me/frame-representation-hypothesis.git

Title: Video Motion Transfer with Diffusion Transformers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07776
Summary: We propose DiTFlow, a method for transferring the motion of a reference video to a newly synthesized one, designed specifically for Diffusion Transformers (DiT). We first process the reference video with a pre-trained DiT to analyze cross-frame attention maps and extract a patch-wise motion signal called the Attention Motion Flow (AMF). We guide the latent denoising process in an optimization-based, training-free, manner by optimizing latents with our AMF loss to generate videos reproducing the motion of the reference one. We also apply our optimization strategy to transformer positional embeddings, granting us a boost in zero-shot motion transfer capabilities. We evaluate DiTFlow against recently published methods, outperforming all across multiple metrics and human evaluation.

Title: FiVA: Fine-grained Visual Attribute Dataset for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07674
Summary: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images with diverse applications. However, accurately describing desired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art and photography. An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes from the source images. Current methods attempt to distill identity and style from source images. However, "style" is a broad concept that includes texture, color, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes such as lighting and dynamics. Additionally, a simplified "style" adaptation prevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one generated image. In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to decompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, allowing users to apply characteristics such as lighting, texture, and dynamics from different images. To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained visual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. This FiVA dataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes around 1 M high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attribute adaptation framework (FiVA-Adapter), which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one or more source images into a generated one. This approach enhances user-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired attributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific content requirements.

Title: A New Federated Learning Framework Against Gradient Inversion Attacks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07187
Summary: Federated Learning (FL) aims to protect data privacy by enabling clients to collectively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. However, recent studies demonstrate that information exchanged during FL is subject to Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIA) and, consequently, a variety of privacy-preserving methods have been integrated into FL to thwart such attacks, such as Secure Multi-party Computing (SMC), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Differential Privacy (DP). Despite their ability to protect data privacy, these approaches inherently involve substantial privacy-utility trade-offs. By revisiting the key to privacy exposure in FL under GIA, which lies in the frequent sharing of model gradients that contain private data, we take a new perspective by designing a novel privacy preserve FL framework that effectively ``breaks the direct connection'' between the shared parameters and the local private data to defend against GIA. Specifically, we propose a Hypernetwork Federated Learning (HyperFL) framework that utilizes hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model and only the hypernetwork parameters are uploaded to the server for aggregation. Theoretical analyses demonstrate the convergence rate of the proposed HyperFL, while extensive experimental results show the privacy-preserving capability and comparable performance of HyperFL. Code is available at https://github.com/Pengxin-Guo/HyperFL.

Title: STIV: Scalable Text and Image Conditioned Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07730
Summary: The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.

Title: DiffSensei: Bridging Multi-Modal LLMs and Diffusion Models for Customized Manga Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07589
Summary: Story visualization, the task of creating visual narratives from textual descriptions, has seen progress with text-to-image generation models. However, these models often lack effective control over character appearances and interactions, particularly in multi-character scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a new task: customized manga generation and introduce DiffSensei, an innovative framework specifically designed for generating manga with dynamic multi-character control. DiffSensei integrates a diffusion-based image generator with a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that acts as a text-compatible identity adapter. Our approach employs masked cross-attention to seamlessly incorporate character features, enabling precise layout control without direct pixel transfer. Additionally, the MLLM-based adapter adjusts character features to align with panel-specific text cues, allowing flexible adjustments in character expressions, poses, and actions. We also introduce MangaZero, a large-scale dataset tailored to this task, containing 43,264 manga pages and 427,147 annotated panels, supporting the visualization of varied character interactions and movements across sequential frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSensei outperforms existing models, marking a significant advancement in manga generation by enabling text-adaptable character customization.

Title: EMOv2: Pushing 5M Vision Model Frontier
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06674
Summary: This work focuses on developing parameter-efficient and lightweight models for dense predictions while trading off parameters, FLOPs, and performance. Our goal is to set up the new frontier of the 5M magnitude lightweight model on various downstream tasks. Inverted Residual Block (IRB) serves as the infrastructure for lightweight CNNs, but no counterparts have been recognized by attention-based design. Our work rethinks the lightweight infrastructure of efficient IRB and practical components in Transformer from a unified perspective, extending CNN-based IRB to attention-based models and abstracting a one-residual Meta Mobile Block (MMBlock) for lightweight model design. Following neat but effective design criterion, we deduce a modern Improved Inverted Residual Mobile Block (i2RMB) and improve a hierarchical Efficient MOdel (EMOv2) with no elaborate complex structures. Considering the imperceptible latency for mobile users when downloading models under 4G/5G bandwidth and ensuring model performance, we investigate the performance upper limit of lightweight models with a magnitude of 5M. Extensive experiments on various vision recognition, dense prediction, and image generation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our EMOv2 over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., EMOv2-1M/2M/5M achieve 72.3, 75.8, and 79.4 Top-1 that surpass equal-order CNN-/Attention-based models significantly. At the same time, EMOv2-5M equipped RetinaNet achieves 41.5 mAP for object detection tasks that surpasses the previous EMO-5M by +2.6. When employing the more robust training recipe, our EMOv2-5M eventually achieves 82.9 Top-1 accuracy, which elevates the performance of 5M magnitude models to a new level.

Title: ObjCtrl-2.5D: Training-free Object Control with Camera Poses
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07721
Summary: This study aims to achieve more precise and versatile object control in image-to-video (I2V) generation. Current methods typically represent the spatial movement of target objects with 2D trajectories, which often fail to capture user intention and frequently produce unnatural results. To enhance control, we present ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free object control approach that uses a 3D trajectory, extended from a 2D trajectory with depth information, as a control signal. By modeling object movement as camera movement, ObjCtrl-2.5D represents the 3D trajectory as a sequence of camera poses, enabling object motion control using an existing camera motion control I2V generation model (CMC-I2V) without training. To adapt the CMC-I2V model originally designed for global motion control to handle local object motion, we introduce a module to isolate the target object from the background, enabling independent local control. In addition, we devise an effective way to achieve more accurate object control by sharing low-frequency warped latent within the object's region across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ObjCtrl-2.5D significantly improves object control accuracy compared to training-free methods and offers more diverse control capabilities than training-based approaches using 2D trajectories, enabling complex effects like object rotation. Code and results are available at https://wzhouxiff.github.io/projects/ObjCtrl-2.5D/.

Title: Perception Tokens Enhance Visual Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03548
Summary: Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities.

Title: Evaluating and Aligning CodeLLMs on Human Preference
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05210
Summary: Code large language models (codeLLMs) have made significant strides in code generation. Most previous code-related benchmarks, which consist of various programming exercises along with the corresponding test cases, are used as a common measure to evaluate the performance and capabilities of code LLMs. However, the current code LLMs focus on synthesizing the correct code snippet, ignoring the alignment with human preferences, where the query should be sampled from the practical application scenarios and the model-generated responses should satisfy the human preference. To bridge the gap between the model-generated response and human preference, we present a rigorous human-curated benchmark CodeArena to emulate the complexity and diversity of real-world coding tasks, where 397 high-quality samples spanning 40 categories and 44 programming languages, carefully curated from user queries. Further, we propose a diverse synthetic instruction corpus SynCode-Instruct (nearly 20B tokens) by scaling instructions from the website to verify the effectiveness of the large-scale synthetic instruction fine-tuning, where Qwen2.5-SynCoder totally trained on synthetic instruction data can achieve top-tier performance of open-source code LLMs. The results find performance differences between execution-based benchmarks and CodeArena. Our systematic experiments of CodeArena on 40+ LLMs reveal a notable performance gap between open SOTA code LLMs (e.g. Qwen2.5-Coder) and proprietary LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1), underscoring the importance of the human preference alignment.\url{https://codearenaeval.github.io/ }

Title: Hidden in the Noise: Two-Stage Robust Watermarking for Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04653
Summary: As the quality of image generators continues to improve, deepfakes become a topic of considerable societal debate. Image watermarking allows responsible model owners to detect and label their AI-generated content, which can mitigate the harm. Yet, current state-of-the-art methods in image watermarking remain vulnerable to forgery and removal attacks. This vulnerability occurs in part because watermarks distort the distribution of generated images, unintentionally revealing information about the watermarking techniques.   In this work, we first demonstrate a distortion-free watermarking method for images, based on a diffusion model's initial noise. However, detecting the watermark requires comparing the initial noise reconstructed for an image to all previously used initial noises. To mitigate these issues, we propose a two-stage watermarking framework for efficient detection. During generation, we augment the initial noise with generated Fourier patterns to embed information about the group of initial noises we used. For detection, we (i) retrieve the relevant group of noises, and (ii) search within the given group for an initial noise that might match our image. This watermarking approach achieves state-of-the-art robustness to forgery and removal against a large battery of attacks.

Title: UniReal: Universal Image Generation and Editing via Learning Real-world Dynamics
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07774
Summary: We introduce UniReal, a unified framework designed to address various image generation and editing tasks. Existing solutions often vary by tasks, yet share fundamental principles: preserving consistency between inputs and outputs while capturing visual variations. Inspired by recent video generation models that effectively balance consistency and variation across frames, we propose a unifying approach that treats image-level tasks as discontinuous video generation. Specifically, we treat varying numbers of input and output images as frames, enabling seamless support for tasks such as image generation, editing, customization, composition, etc. Although designed for image-level tasks, we leverage videos as a scalable source for universal supervision. UniReal learns world dynamics from large-scale videos, demonstrating advanced capability in handling shadows, reflections, pose variation, and object interaction, while also exhibiting emergent capability for novel applications.

Title: Granite Guardian
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07724
Summary: We introduce the Granite Guardian models, a suite of safeguards designed to provide risk detection for prompts and responses, enabling safe and responsible use in combination with any large language model (LLM). These models offer comprehensive coverage across multiple risk dimensions, including social bias, profanity, violence, sexual content, unethical behavior, jailbreaking, and hallucination-related risks such as context relevance, groundedness, and answer relevance for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Trained on a unique dataset combining human annotations from diverse sources and synthetic data, Granite Guardian models address risks typically overlooked by traditional risk detection models, such as jailbreaks and RAG-specific issues. With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive model available in the space. Released as open-source, Granite Guardian aims to promote responsible AI development across the community.   https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-guardian

Title: Fully Open Source Moxin-7B Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06845
Summary: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA and Mistral, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, and some use restrictive licenses whilst claiming to be "open-source," which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed in accordance with the Model Openness Framework (MOF), a ranked classification system that evaluates AI models based on model completeness and openness, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. Our model achieves the highest MOF classification level of "open science" through the comprehensive release of pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints. Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance in zero-shot evaluation compared with popular 7B models and performs competitively in few-shot evaluation.

Title: ILLUME: Illuminating Your LLMs to See, Draw, and Self-Enhance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06673
Summary: In this paper, we introduce ILLUME, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that seamlessly integrates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities within a single large language model through a unified next-token prediction formulation. To address the large dataset size typically required for image-text alignment, we propose to enhance data efficiency through the design of a vision tokenizer that incorporates semantic information and a progressive multi-stage training procedure. This approach reduces the dataset size to just 15M for pretraining -- over four times fewer than what is typically needed -- while achieving competitive or even superior performance with existing unified MLLMs, such as Janus. Additionally, to promote synergistic enhancement between understanding and generation capabilities, which is under-explored in previous works, we introduce a novel self-enhancing multimodal alignment scheme. This scheme supervises the MLLM to self-assess the consistency between text descriptions and self-generated images, facilitating the model to interpret images more accurately and avoid unrealistic and incorrect predictions caused by misalignment in image generation. Based on extensive experiments, our proposed ILLUME stands out and competes with state-of-the-art unified MLLMs and specialized models across various benchmarks for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

Title: Maya: An Instruction Finetuned Multilingual Multimodal Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07112
Summary: The rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has led to impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages. However, significant gaps remain in the ability of current VLMs to handle low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts, largely due to a lack of high-quality, diverse, and safety-vetted data. Consequently, these models often struggle to understand low-resource languages and cultural nuances in a manner free from toxicity. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multimodal Multilingual model. Our contributions are threefold: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; 2) a thorough analysis of toxicity within the LLaVA dataset, followed by the creation of a novel toxicity-free version across eight languages; and 3) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

Title: Gated Delta Networks: Improving Mamba2 with Delta Rule
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06464
Summary: Linear Transformers have gained attention as efficient alternatives to standard Transformers, but their performance in retrieval and long-context tasks has been limited. To address these limitations, recent work has explored two distinct mechanisms: gating for adaptive memory control and the delta update rule for precise memory modifications. We observe that these mechanisms are complementary: gating enables rapid memory erasure while the delta rule facilitates targeted updates. Building on this insight, we introduce the gated delta rule and develop a parallel training algorithm optimized for modern hardware. Our proposed architecture, Gated DeltaNet, consistently surpasses existing models like Mamba2 and DeltaNet across multiple benchmarks, including language modeling, common-sense reasoning, in-context retrieval, length extrapolation, and long-context understanding. We further enhance performance by developing hybrid architectures that combine Gated DeltaNet layers with sliding window attention or Mamba2 layers, achieving both improved training efficiency and superior task performance.

Title: Turbo3D: Ultra-fast Text-to-3D Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04470
Summary: We present Turbo3D, an ultra-fast text-to-3D system capable of generating high-quality Gaussian splatting assets in under one second. Turbo3D employs a rapid 4-step, 4-view diffusion generator and an efficient feed-forward Gaussian reconstructor, both operating in latent space. The 4-step, 4-view generator is a student model distilled through a novel Dual-Teacher approach, which encourages the student to learn view consistency from a multi-view teacher and photo-realism from a single-view teacher. By shifting the Gaussian reconstructor's inputs from pixel space to latent space, we eliminate the extra image decoding time and halve the transformer sequence length for maximum efficiency. Our method demonstrates superior 3D generation results compared to previous baselines, while operating in a fraction of their runtime.

Title: MAtCha Gaussians: Atlas of Charts for High-Quality Geometry and Photorealism From Sparse Views
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06767
Summary: We present a novel appearance model that simultaneously realizes explicit high-quality 3D surface mesh recovery and photorealistic novel view synthesis from sparse view samples. Our key idea is to model the underlying scene geometry Mesh as an Atlas of Charts which we render with 2D Gaussian surfels (MAtCha Gaussians). MAtCha distills high-frequency scene surface details from an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator and refines it through Gaussian surfel rendering. The Gaussian surfels are attached to the charts on the fly, satisfying photorealism of neural volumetric rendering and crisp geometry of a mesh model, i.e., two seemingly contradicting goals in a single model. At the core of MAtCha lies a novel neural deformation model and a structure loss that preserve the fine surface details distilled from learned monocular depths while addressing their fundamental scale ambiguities. Results of extensive experimental validation demonstrate MAtCha's state-of-the-art quality of surface reconstruction and photorealism on-par with top contenders but with dramatic reduction in the number of input views and computational time. We believe MAtCha will serve as a foundational tool for any visual application in vision, graphics, and robotics that require explicit geometry in addition to photorealism.

Title: If You Can't Use Them, Recycle Them: Optimizing Merging at Scale Mitigates Performance Tradeoffs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04144
Summary: Model merging has shown great promise at combining expert models, but the benefit of merging is unclear when merging ``generalist'' models trained on many tasks. We explore merging in the context of large (sim100B) models, by recycling checkpoints that exhibit tradeoffs among different tasks. Such checkpoints are often created in the process of developing a frontier model, and many suboptimal ones are usually discarded. Given a pool of model checkpoints obtained from different training runs (e.g., different stages, objectives, hyperparameters, and data mixtures), which naturally show tradeoffs across different language capabilities (e.g., instruction following vs. code generation), we investigate whether merging can recycle such suboptimal models into a Pareto-optimal one. Our optimization algorithm tunes the weight of each checkpoint in a linear combination, resulting in a Pareto-optimal models that outperforms both individual models and merge-based baselines. Further analysis shows that good merges tend to include almost all checkpoints with with non-zero weights, indicating that even seemingly bad initial checkpoints can contribute to good final merges.

Title: Around the World in 80 Timesteps: A Generative Approach to Global Visual Geolocation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06781
Summary: Global visual geolocation predicts where an image was captured on Earth. Since images vary in how precisely they can be localized, this task inherently involves a significant degree of ambiguity. However, existing approaches are deterministic and overlook this aspect. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between traditional geolocalization and modern generative methods. We propose the first generative geolocation approach based on diffusion and Riemannian flow matching, where the denoising process operates directly on the Earth's surface. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three visual geolocation benchmarks: OpenStreetView-5M, YFCC-100M, and iNat21. In addition, we introduce the task of probabilistic visual geolocation, where the model predicts a probability distribution over all possible locations instead of a single point. We introduce new metrics and baselines for this task, demonstrating the advantages of our diffusion-based approach. Codes and models will be made available.

Title: MotionShop: Zero-Shot Motion Transfer in Video Diffusion Models with Mixture of Score Guidance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05355
Summary: In this work, we propose the first motion transfer approach in diffusion transformer through Mixture of Score Guidance (MSG), a theoretically-grounded framework for motion transfer in diffusion models. Our key theoretical contribution lies in reformulating conditional score to decompose motion score and content score in diffusion models. By formulating motion transfer as a mixture of potential energies, MSG naturally preserves scene composition and enables creative scene transformations while maintaining the integrity of transferred motion patterns. This novel sampling operates directly on pre-trained video diffusion models without additional training or fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, MSG demonstrates successful handling of diverse scenarios including single object, multiple objects, and cross-object motion transfer as well as complex camera motion transfer. Additionally, we introduce MotionBench, the first motion transfer dataset consisting of 200 source videos and 1000 transferred motions, covering single/multi-object transfers, and complex camera motions.
