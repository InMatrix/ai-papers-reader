Title: Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23798
Summary: Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.

Title: Quamba2: A Robust and Scalable Post-training Quantization Framework for
  Selective State Space Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22879
Summary: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input x, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters B and C. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms several state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3times and 3times speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4times memory reduction with only a 1.6% average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.

Title: Target-Aware Video Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18950
Summary: We present a target-aware video diffusion model that generates videos from an input image in which an actor interacts with a specified target while performing a desired action. The target is defined by a segmentation mask and the desired action is described via a text prompt. Unlike existing controllable image-to-video diffusion models that often rely on dense structural or motion cues to guide the actor's movements toward the target, our target-aware model requires only a simple mask to indicate the target, leveraging the generalization capabilities of pretrained models to produce plausible actions. This makes our method particularly effective for human-object interaction (HOI) scenarios, where providing precise action guidance is challenging, and further enables the use of video diffusion models for high-level action planning in applications such as robotics. We build our target-aware model by extending a baseline model to incorporate the target mask as an additional input. To enforce target awareness, we introduce a special token that encodes the target's spatial information within the text prompt. We then fine-tune the model with our curated dataset using a novel cross-attention loss that aligns the cross-attention maps associated with this token with the input target mask. To further improve performance, we selectively apply this loss to the most semantically relevant transformer blocks and attention regions. Experimental results show that our target-aware model outperforms existing solutions in generating videos where actors interact accurately with the specified targets. We further demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream applications: video content creation and zero-shot 3D HOI motion synthesis.

Title: MegaTTS 3: Sparse Alignment Enhanced Latent Diffusion Transformer for
  Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18924
Summary: While recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models have significantly improved speech quality and expressiveness, mainstream systems still suffer from issues related to speech-text alignment modeling: 1) models without explicit speech-text alignment modeling exhibit less robustness, especially for hard sentences in practical applications; 2) predefined alignment-based models suffer from naturalness constraints of forced alignments. This paper introduces MegaTTS 3, a TTS system featuring an innovative sparse alignment algorithm that guides the latent diffusion transformer (DiT). Specifically, we provide sparse alignment boundaries to MegaTTS 3 to reduce the difficulty of alignment without limiting the search space, thereby achieving high naturalness. Moreover, we employ a multi-condition classifier-free guidance strategy for accent intensity adjustment and adopt the piecewise rectified flow technique to accelerate the generation process. Experiments demonstrate that MegaTTS 3 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS speech quality and supports highly flexible control over accent intensity. Notably, our system can generate high-quality one-minute speech with only 8 sampling steps. Audio samples are available at https://sditdemo.github.io/sditdemo/.

Title: Medical large language models are easily distracted
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01201
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to transform medicine, but real-world clinical scenarios contain extraneous information that can hinder performance. The rise of assistive technologies like ambient dictation, which automatically generates draft notes from live patient encounters, has the potential to introduce additional noise making it crucial to assess the ability of LLM's to filter relevant data. To investigate this, we developed MedDistractQA, a benchmark using USMLE-style questions embedded with simulated real-world distractions. Our findings show that distracting statements (polysemous words with clinical meanings used in a non-clinical context or references to unrelated health conditions) can reduce LLM accuracy by up to 17.9%. Commonly proposed solutions to improve model performance such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and medical fine-tuning did not change this effect and in some cases introduced their own confounders and further degraded performance. Our findings suggest that LLMs natively lack the logical mechanisms necessary to distinguish relevant from irrelevant clinical information, posing challenges for real-world applications. MedDistractQA and our results highlights the need for robust mitigation strategies to enhance LLM resilience to extraneous information.

Title: Towards Physically Plausible Video Generation via VLM Planning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23368
Summary: Video diffusion models (VDMs) have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the generation of highly realistic videos and drawing the attention of the community in their potential as world simulators. However, despite their capabilities, VDMs often fail to produce physically plausible videos due to an inherent lack of understanding of physics, resulting in incorrect dynamics and event sequences. To address this limitation, we propose a novel two-stage image-to-video generation framework that explicitly incorporates physics. In the first stage, we employ a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a coarse-grained motion planner, integrating chain-of-thought and physics-aware reasoning to predict a rough motion trajectories/changes that approximate real-world physical dynamics while ensuring the inter-frame consistency. In the second stage, we use the predicted motion trajectories/changes to guide the video generation of a VDM. As the predicted motion trajectories/changes are rough, noise is added during inference to provide freedom to the VDM in generating motion with more fine details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can produce physically plausible motion, and comparative evaluations highlight the notable superiority of our approach over existing methods. More video results are available on our Project Page: https://madaoer.github.io/projects/physically_plausible_video_generation.

Title: DASH: Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations of VLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23573
Summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to object hallucinations, where they erroneously indicate the presenceof certain objects in an image. Existing benchmarks quantify hallucinations using relatively small, labeled datasets. However, this approach is i) insufficient to assess hallucinations that arise in open-world settings, where VLMs are widely used, and ii) inadequate for detecting systematic errors in VLMs. We propose DASH (Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations), an automatic, large-scale pipeline designed to identify systematic hallucinations of VLMs on real-world images in an open-world setting. A key component is DASH-OPT for image-based retrieval, where we optimize over the ''natural image manifold'' to generate images that mislead the VLM. The output of DASH consists of clusters of real and semantically similar images for which the VLM hallucinates an object. We apply DASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 object classes and, in total, find more than 19k clusters with 950k images. We study the transfer of the identified systematic hallucinations to other VLMs and show that fine-tuning PaliGemma with the model-specific images obtained with DASH mitigates object hallucinations. Code and data are available at https://YanNeu.github.io/DASH.

Title: Enhanced OoD Detection through Cross-Modal Alignment of Multi-Modal
  Representations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18817
Summary: Prior research on out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) has primarily focused on single-modality models. Recently, with the advent of large-scale pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP, OoDD methods utilizing such multi-modal representations through zero-shot and prompt learning strategies have emerged. However, these methods typically involve either freezing the pretrained weights or only partially tuning them, which can be suboptimal for downstream datasets. In this paper, we highlight that multi-modal fine-tuning (MMFT) can achieve notable OoDD performance. Despite some recent works demonstrating the impact of fine-tuning methods for OoDD, there remains significant potential for performance improvement. We investigate the limitation of na\"ive fine-tuning methods, examining why they fail to fully leverage the pretrained knowledge. Our empirical analysis suggests that this issue could stem from the modality gap within in-distribution (ID) embeddings. To address this, we propose a training objective that enhances cross-modal alignment by regularizing the distances between image and text embeddings of ID data. This adjustment helps in better utilizing pretrained textual information by aligning similar semantics from different modalities (i.e., text and image) more closely in the hyperspherical representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed regularization corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimation of an energy-based model on a hypersphere. Utilizing ImageNet-1k OoD benchmark datasets, we show that our method, combined with post-hoc OoDD approaches leveraging pretrained knowledge (e.g., NegLabel), significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art OoDD performance and leading ID accuracy.

Title: VerifiAgent: a Unified Verification Agent in Language Model Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00406
Summary: Large language models demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities but often produce unreliable or incorrect responses. Existing verification methods are typically model-specific or domain-restricted, requiring significant computational resources and lacking scalability across diverse reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we propose VerifiAgent, a unified verification agent that integrates two levels of verification: meta-verification, which assesses completeness and consistency in model responses, and tool-based adaptive verification, where VerifiAgent autonomously selects appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type, including mathematical, logical, or commonsense reasoning. This adaptive approach ensures both efficiency and robustness across different verification scenarios. Experimental results show that VerifiAgent outperforms baseline verification methods (e.g., deductive verifier, backward verifier) among all reasoning tasks. Additionally, it can further enhance reasoning accuracy by leveraging feedback from verification results. VerifiAgent can also be effectively applied to inference scaling, achieving better results with fewer generated samples and costs compared to existing process reward models in the mathematical reasoning domain.

Title: Boost Your Own Human Image Generation Model via Direct Preference
  Optimization with AI Feedback
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20216
Summary: The generation of high-quality human images through text-to-image (T2I) methods is a significant yet challenging task. Distinct from general image generation, human image synthesis must satisfy stringent criteria related to human pose, anatomy, and alignment with textual prompts, making it particularly difficult to achieve realistic results. Recent advancements in T2I generation based on diffusion models have shown promise, yet challenges remain in meeting human-specific preferences. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach tailored specifically for human image generation utilizing Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, we introduce an efficient method for constructing a specialized DPO dataset for training human image generation models without the need for costly human feedback. We also propose a modified loss function that enhances the DPO training process by minimizing artifacts and improving image fidelity. Our method demonstrates its versatility and effectiveness in generating human images, including personalized text-to-image generation. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our approach significantly advances the state of human image generation, achieving superior results in terms of natural anatomies, poses, and text-image alignment.

Title: Understanding R1-Zero-Like Training: A Critical Perspective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20783
Summary: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) at scale can directly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs without supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we critically examine R1-Zero-like training by analyzing its two core components: base models and RL. We investigate a wide range of base models, including DeepSeek-V3-Base, to understand how pretraining characteristics influence RL performance. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek-V3-Base already exhibit ''Aha moment'', while Qwen2.5 base models demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities even without prompt templates, suggesting potential pretraining biases. Additionally, we identify an optimization bias in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which artificially increases response length (especially for incorrect outputs) during training. To address this, we introduce Dr. GRPO, an unbiased optimization method that improves token efficiency while maintaining reasoning performance. Leveraging these insights, we present a minimalist R1-Zero recipe that achieves 43.3% accuracy on AIME 2024 with a 7B base model, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/understand-r1-zero.

Title: VideoScene: Distilling Video Diffusion Model to Generate 3D Scenes in
  One Step
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01956
Summary: Recovering 3D scenes from sparse views is a challenging task due to its inherent ill-posed problem. Conventional methods have developed specialized solutions (e.g., geometry regularization or feed-forward deterministic model) to mitigate the issue. However, they still suffer from performance degradation by minimal overlap across input views with insufficient visual information. Fortunately, recent video generative models show promise in addressing this challenge as they are capable of generating video clips with plausible 3D structures. Powered by large pretrained video diffusion models, some pioneering research start to explore the potential of video generative prior and create 3D scenes from sparse views. Despite impressive improvements, they are limited by slow inference time and the lack of 3D constraint, leading to inefficiencies and reconstruction artifacts that do not align with real-world geometry structure. In this paper, we propose VideoScene to distill the video diffusion model to generate 3D scenes in one step, aiming to build an efficient and effective tool to bridge the gap from video to 3D. Specifically, we design a 3D-aware leap flow distillation strategy to leap over time-consuming redundant information and train a dynamic denoising policy network to adaptively determine the optimal leap timestep during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VideoScene achieves faster and superior 3D scene generation results than previous video diffusion models, highlighting its potential as an efficient tool for future video to 3D applications.

Title: ILLUME+: Illuminating Unified MLLM with Dual Visual Tokenization and
  Diffusion Refinement
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01934
Summary: We present ILLUME+ that leverages dual visual tokenization and a diffusion decoder to improve both deep semantic understanding and high-fidelity image generation. Existing unified models have struggled to simultaneously handle the three fundamental capabilities in a unified model: understanding, generation, and editing. Models like Chameleon and EMU3 utilize VQGAN for image discretization, due to the lack of deep semantic interaction, they lag behind specialist models like LLaVA in visual understanding tasks. To mitigate this, LaViT and ILLUME employ semantic encoders for tokenization, but they struggle with image editing due to poor texture preservation. Meanwhile, Janus series decouples the input and output image representation, limiting their abilities to seamlessly handle interleaved image-text understanding and generation. In contrast, ILLUME+ introduces a unified dual visual tokenizer, DualViTok, which preserves both fine-grained textures and text-aligned semantics while enabling a coarse-to-fine image representation strategy for multimodal understanding and generation. Additionally, we employ a diffusion model as the image detokenizer for enhanced generation quality and efficient super-resolution. ILLUME+ follows a continuous-input, discrete-output scheme within the unified MLLM and adopts a progressive training procedure that supports dynamic resolution across the vision tokenizer, MLLM, and diffusion decoder. This design allows for flexible and efficient context-aware image editing and generation across diverse tasks. ILLUME+ (3B) exhibits competitive performance against existing unified MLLMs and specialized models across multimodal understanding, generation, and editing benchmarks. With its strong performance, ILLUME+ provides a scalable and versatile foundation for future multimodal applications. Project Page: https://illume-unified-mllm.github.io/.

Title: DreamActor-M1: Holistic, Expressive and Robust Human Image Animation
  with Hybrid Guidance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01724
Summary: While recent image-based human animation methods achieve realistic body and facial motion synthesis, critical gaps remain in fine-grained holistic controllability, multi-scale adaptability, and long-term temporal coherence, which leads to their lower expressiveness and robustness. We propose a diffusion transformer (DiT) based framework, DreamActor-M1, with hybrid guidance to overcome these limitations. For motion guidance, our hybrid control signals that integrate implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D body skeletons achieve robust control of facial expressions and body movements, while producing expressive and identity-preserving animations. For scale adaptation, to handle various body poses and image scales ranging from portraits to full-body views, we employ a progressive training strategy using data with varying resolutions and scales. For appearance guidance, we integrate motion patterns from sequential frames with complementary visual references, ensuring long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions during complex movements. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works, delivering expressive results for portraits, upper-body, and full-body generation with robust long-term consistency.

Title: AnimeGamer: Infinite Anime Life Simulation with Next Game State
  Prediction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01014
Summary: Recent advancements in image and video synthesis have opened up new promise in generative games. One particularly intriguing application is transforming characters from anime films into interactive, playable entities. This allows players to immerse themselves in the dynamic anime world as their favorite characters for life simulation through language instructions. Such games are defined as infinite game since they eliminate predetermined boundaries and fixed gameplay rules, where players can interact with the game world through open-ended language and experience ever-evolving storylines and environments. Recently, a pioneering approach for infinite anime life simulation employs large language models (LLMs) to translate multi-turn text dialogues into language instructions for image generation. However, it neglects historical visual context, leading to inconsistent gameplay. Furthermore, it only generates static images, failing to incorporate the dynamics necessary for an engaging gaming experience. In this work, we propose AnimeGamer, which is built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate each game state, including dynamic animation shots that depict character movements and updates to character states, as illustrated in Figure 1. We introduce novel action-aware multimodal representations to represent animation shots, which can be decoded into high-quality video clips using a video diffusion model. By taking historical animation shot representations as context and predicting subsequent representations, AnimeGamer can generate games with contextual consistency and satisfactory dynamics. Extensive evaluations using both automated metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that AnimeGamer outperforms existing methods in various aspects of the gaming experience. Codes and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/AnimeGamer.

Title: Articulated Kinematics Distillation from Video Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01204
Summary: We present Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD), a framework for generating high-fidelity character animations by merging the strengths of skeleton-based animation and modern generative models. AKD uses a skeleton-based representation for rigged 3D assets, drastically reducing the Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) by focusing on joint-level control, which allows for efficient, consistent motion synthesis. Through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with pre-trained video diffusion models, AKD distills complex, articulated motions while maintaining structural integrity, overcoming challenges faced by 4D neural deformation fields in preserving shape consistency. This approach is naturally compatible with physics-based simulation, ensuring physically plausible interactions. Experiments show that AKD achieves superior 3D consistency and motion quality compared with existing works on text-to-4D generation. Project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/akd/

Title: PaperBench: Evaluating AI's Ability to Replicate AI Research
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01848
Summary: We introduce PaperBench, a benchmark evaluating the ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch, including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains 8,316 individually gradable tasks. Rubrics are co-developed with the author(s) of each ICML paper for accuracy and realism. To enable scalable evaluation, we also develop an LLM-based judge to automatically grade replication attempts against rubrics, and assess our judge's performance by creating a separate benchmark for judges. We evaluate several frontier models on PaperBench, finding that the best-performing tested agent, Claude 3.5 Sonnet (New) with open-source scaffolding, achieves an average replication score of 21.0\%. Finally, we recruit top ML PhDs to attempt a subset of PaperBench, finding that models do not yet outperform the human baseline. We https://github.com/openai/preparedness{open-source our code} to facilitate future research in understanding the AI engineering capabilities of AI agents.

Title: Improved Visual-Spatial Reasoning via R1-Zero-Like Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00883
Summary: Increasing attention has been placed on improving the reasoning capacities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). As the cornerstone for AI agents that function in the physical realm, video-based visual-spatial intelligence (VSI) emerges as one of the most pivotal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. This work conducts a first, in-depth study on improving the visual-spatial reasoning of MLLMs via R1-Zero-like training. Technically, we first identify that the visual-spatial reasoning capacities of small- to medium-sized Qwen2-VL models cannot be activated via Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts. We then incorporate GRPO training for improved visual-spatial reasoning, using the carefully curated VSI-100k dataset, following DeepSeek-R1-Zero. During the investigation, we identify the necessity to keep the KL penalty (even with a small value) in GRPO. With just 120 GPU hours, our vsGRPO-2B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-2B, can outperform the base model by 12.1% and surpass GPT-4o. Moreover, our vsGRPO-7B model, fine-tuned from Qwen2-VL-7B, achieves performance comparable to that of the best open-source model LLaVA-NeXT-Video-72B. Additionally, we compare vsGRPO to supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization baselines and observe strong performance superiority. The code and dataset will be available soon.

Title: LSNet: See Large, Focus Small
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23135
Summary: Vision network designs, including Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers, have significantly advanced the field of computer vision. Yet, their complex computations pose challenges for practical deployments, particularly in real-time applications. To tackle this issue, researchers have explored various lightweight and efficient network designs. However, existing lightweight models predominantly leverage self-attention mechanisms and convolutions for token mixing. This dependence brings limitations in effectiveness and efficiency in the perception and aggregation processes of lightweight networks, hindering the balance between performance and efficiency under limited computational budgets. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the dynamic heteroscale vision ability inherent in the efficient human vision system and propose a ``See Large, Focus Small'' strategy for lightweight vision network design. We introduce LS (Large-Small) convolution, which combines large-kernel perception and small-kernel aggregation. It can efficiently capture a wide range of perceptual information and achieve precise feature aggregation for dynamic and complex visual representations, thus enabling proficient processing of visual information. Based on LS convolution, we present LSNet, a new family of lightweight models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSNet achieves superior performance and efficiency over existing lightweight networks in various vision tasks. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/jameslahm/lsnet.

Title: MergeVQ: A Unified Framework for Visual Generation and Representation
  with Disentangled Token Merging and Quantization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00999
Summary: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with Vector Quantization (VQ) has achieved great success in both self-supervised pre-training and image generation. However, most existing methods struggle to address the trade-off in shared latent space for generation quality vs. representation learning and efficiency. To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for the second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed. The code and model will be available at https://apexgen-x.github.io/MergeVQ.

Title: ScholarCopilot: Training Large Language Models for Academic Writing with
  Accurate Citations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00824
Summary: Academic writing requires both coherent text generation and precise citation of relevant literature. Although recent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have significantly improved factual accuracy in general-purpose text generation, their capacity to adequately support professional academic writing remains limited. In this work, we introduce ScholarCopilot, a unified framework designed to enhance existing large language models for generating professional academic articles with accurate and contextually relevant citations. ScholarCopilot dynamically determines when to retrieve scholarly references by generating a retrieval token [RET], and then utilizes its representation to look up relevant citations from a database. The retrieved references are fed into the model to augment the generation process. We jointly optimize both the generation and citation tasks within a single framework to increase efficiency. Trained on 500K papers from arXiv, our model achieves a top-1 retrieval accuracy of 40.1% on our evaluation dataset, outperforming baselines such as E5-Mistral-7B-Instruct (15.0%) and BM25 (9.8%). On a dataset of 1,000 academic writing samples, ScholarCopilot scores 16.2/25 in generation quality (measured across relevance, coherence, academic rigor, completeness, and innovation), surpassing models with 10x more parameters such as Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct (15.8/25). Human studies also confirm ScholarCopilot's superior performance in citation recall, writing efficiency, and overall user experience, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to
  Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01308
Summary: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/DiffPure-RobustVLM.

Title: YourBench: Easy Custom Evaluation Sets for Everyone
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01833
Summary: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) effectively remains a critical bottleneck, as traditional static benchmarks suffer from saturation and contamination, while human evaluations are costly and slow. This hinders timely or domain-specific assessment, crucial for real-world applications. We introduce YourBench, a novel, open-source framework that addresses these limitations by enabling dynamic, automated generation of reliable, up-to-date, and domain-tailored benchmarks cheaply and without manual annotation, directly from user-provided documents. We demonstrate its efficacy by replicating 7 diverse MMLU subsets using minimal source text, achieving this for under 15 USD in total inference costs while perfectly preserving the relative model performance rankings (Spearman Rho = 1) observed on the original benchmark. To ensure that YourBench generates data grounded in provided input instead of relying on posterior parametric knowledge in models, we also introduce Tempora-0325, a novel dataset of over 7K diverse documents, published exclusively after March 2025. Our comprehensive analysis spans 26 SoTA models from 7 major families across varying scales (3-671B parameters) to validate the quality of generated evaluations through rigorous algorithmic checks (e.g., citation grounding) and human assessments. We release the YourBench library, the Tempora-0325 dataset, 150k+ question answer pairs based on Tempora and all evaluation and inference traces to facilitate reproducible research and empower the community to generate bespoke benchmarks on demand, fostering more relevant and trustworthy LLM evaluation.

Title: Landscape of Thoughts: Visualizing the Reasoning Process of Large
  Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22165
Summary: Numerous applications of large language models (LLMs) rely on their ability to perform step-by-step reasoning. However, the reasoning behavior of LLMs remains poorly understood, posing challenges to research, development, and safety. To address this gap, we introduce landscape of thoughts-the first visualization tool for users to inspect the reasoning paths of chain-of-thought and its derivatives on any multi-choice dataset. Specifically, we represent the states in a reasoning path as feature vectors that quantify their distances to all answer choices. These features are then visualized in two-dimensional plots using t-SNE. Qualitative and quantitative analysis with the landscape of thoughts effectively distinguishes between strong and weak models, correct and incorrect answers, as well as different reasoning tasks. It also uncovers undesirable reasoning patterns, such as low consistency and high uncertainty. Additionally, users can adapt our tool to a model that predicts the property they observe. We showcase this advantage by adapting our tool to a lightweight verifier that evaluates the correctness of reasoning paths. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/landscape-of-thoughts.

Title: Reasoning-SQL: Reinforcement Learning with SQL Tailored Partial Rewards
  for Reasoning-Enhanced Text-to-SQL
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23157
Summary: Text-to-SQL is a challenging task involving multiple reasoning-intensive subtasks, including natural language understanding, database schema comprehension, and precise SQL query formulation. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted reasoning paths with inductive biases that can limit their overall effectiveness. Motivated by the recent success of reasoning-enhanced models such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o1, which effectively leverage reward-driven self-exploration to enhance reasoning capabilities and generalization, we propose a novel set of partial rewards tailored specifically for the Text-to-SQL task. Our reward set includes schema-linking, AI feedback, n-gram similarity, and syntax check, explicitly designed to address the reward sparsity issue prevalent in reinforcement learning (RL). Leveraging group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly encourages large language models (LLMs) to develop intrinsic reasoning skills necessary for accurate SQL query generation. With models of different sizes, we demonstrate that RL-only training with our proposed rewards consistently achieves higher accuracy and superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, our RL-trained 14B-parameter model significantly outperforms larger proprietary models, e.g. o3-mini by 4% and Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 by 3% on the BIRD benchmark. These highlight the efficacy of our proposed RL-training framework with partial rewards for enhancing both accuracy and reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL tasks.

Title: MB-ORES: A Multi-Branch Object Reasoner for Visual Grounding in Remote
  Sensing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24219
Summary: We propose a unified framework that integrates object detection (OD) and visual grounding (VG) for remote sensing (RS) imagery. To support conventional OD and establish an intuitive prior for VG task, we fine-tune an open-set object detector using referring expression data, framing it as a partially supervised OD task. In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of each image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal locations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform the VG task. The model consists of: (i) a multi-branch network that integrates spatial, visual, and categorical features to generate task-aware proposals, and (ii) an object reasoning network that assigns probabilities across proposals, followed by a soft selection mechanism for final referring object localization. Our model demonstrates superior performance on the OPT-RSVG and DIOR-RSVG datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while retaining classical OD capabilities. The code will be available in our repository: https://github.com/rd20karim/MB-ORES.

Title: OmniMMI: A Comprehensive Multi-modal Interaction Benchmark in Streaming
  Video Contexts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22952
Summary: The rapid advancement of multi-modal language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4o has propelled the development of Omni language models, designed to process and proactively respond to continuous streams of multi-modal data. Despite their potential, evaluating their real-world interactive capabilities in streaming video contexts remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we introduce OmniMMI, a comprehensive multi-modal interaction benchmark tailored for OmniLLMs in streaming video contexts. OmniMMI encompasses over 1,121 videos and 2,290 questions, addressing two critical yet underexplored challenges in existing video benchmarks: streaming video understanding and proactive reasoning, across six distinct subtasks. Moreover, we propose a novel framework, Multi-modal Multiplexing Modeling (M4), designed to enable an inference-efficient streaming model that can see, listen while generating.

Title: Towards Trustworthy GUI Agents: A Survey
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23434
Summary: GUI agents, powered by large foundation models, can interact with digital interfaces, enabling various applications in web automation, mobile navigation, and software testing. However, their increasing autonomy has raised critical concerns about their security, privacy, and safety. This survey examines the trustworthiness of GUI agents in five critical dimensions: security vulnerabilities, reliability in dynamic environments, transparency and explainability, ethical considerations, and evaluation methodologies. We also identify major challenges such as vulnerability to adversarial attacks, cascading failure modes in sequential decision-making, and a lack of realistic evaluation benchmarks. These issues not only hinder real-world deployment but also call for comprehensive mitigation strategies beyond task success. As GUI agents become more widespread, establishing robust safety standards and responsible development practices is essential. This survey provides a foundation for advancing trustworthy GUI agents through systematic understanding and future research.

Title: Scaling Language-Free Visual Representation Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01017
Summary: Visual Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) currently underperforms Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in multimodal settings such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). This multimodal gap is often attributed to the semantics introduced by language supervision, even though visual SSL and CLIP models are often trained on different data. In this work, we ask the question: "Do visual self-supervised approaches lag behind CLIP due to the lack of language supervision, or differences in the training data?" We study this question by training both visual SSL and CLIP models on the same MetaCLIP data, and leveraging VQA as a diverse testbed for vision encoders. In this controlled setup, visual SSL models scale better than CLIP models in terms of data and model capacity, and visual SSL performance does not saturate even after scaling up to 7B parameters. Consequently, we observe visual SSL methods achieve CLIP-level performance on a wide range of VQA and classic vision benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that pure visual SSL can match language-supervised visual pretraining at scale, opening new opportunities for vision-centric representation learning.

Title: DiET-GS: Diffusion Prior and Event Stream-Assisted Motion Deblurring 3D
  Gaussian Splatting
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24210
Summary: Reconstructing sharp 3D representations from blurry multi-view images are long-standing problem in computer vision. Recent works attempt to enhance high-quality novel view synthesis from the motion blur by leveraging event-based cameras, benefiting from high dynamic range and microsecond temporal resolution. However, they often reach sub-optimal visual quality in either restoring inaccurate color or losing fine-grained details. In this paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral, achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the edge details. Qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our DiET-GS is capable of producing significantly better quality of novel views compared to the existing baselines.

Title: MixerMDM: Learnable Composition of Human Motion Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01019
Summary: Generating human motion guided by conditions such as textual descriptions is challenging due to the need for datasets with pairs of high-quality motion and their corresponding conditions. The difficulty increases when aiming for finer control in the generation. To that end, prior works have proposed to combine several motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of conditions, thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However, the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches, MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models, we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually, and also on the overall interaction. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation technique that, for the first time in this task, measures the interaction and individual quality by computing the alignment between the mixed generated motions and their conditions as well as the capabilities of MixerMDM to adapt the mixing throughout the denoising process depending on the motions to mix.

Title: JudgeLRM: Large Reasoning Models as a Judge
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00050
Summary: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluators offers a scalable alternative to human annotation, yet existing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for judges approaches often fall short in domains requiring complex reasoning. In this work, we investigate whether LLM judges truly benefit from enhanced reasoning capabilities. Through a detailed analysis of reasoning requirements across evaluation tasks, we reveal a negative correlation between SFT performance gains and the proportion of reasoning-demanding samples - highlighting the limitations of SFT in such scenarios. To address this, we introduce JudgeLRM, a family of judgment-oriented LLMs trained using reinforcement learning (RL) with judge-wise, outcome-driven rewards. JudgeLRM models consistently outperform both SFT-tuned and state-of-the-art reasoning models. Notably, JudgeLRM-3B surpasses GPT-4, and JudgeLRM-7B outperforms DeepSeek-R1 by 2.79% in F1 score, particularly excelling in judge tasks requiring deep reasoning.

Title: CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive
  Program Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23145
Summary: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.

Title: Chapter-Llama: Efficient Chaptering in Hour-Long Videos with LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00072
Summary: We address the task of video chaptering, i.e., partitioning a long video timeline into semantic units and generating corresponding chapter titles. While relatively underexplored, automatic chaptering has the potential to enable efficient navigation and content retrieval in long-form videos. In this paper, we achieve strong chaptering performance on hour-long videos by efficiently addressing the problem in the text domain with our 'Chapter-Llama' framework. Specifically, we leverage a pretrained large language model (LLM) with large context window, and feed as input (i) speech transcripts and (ii) captions describing video frames, along with their respective timestamps. Given the inefficiency of exhaustively captioning all frames, we propose a lightweight speech-guided frame selection strategy based on speech transcript content, and experimentally demonstrate remarkable advantages. We train the LLM to output timestamps for the chapter boundaries, as well as free-form chapter titles. This simple yet powerful approach scales to processing one-hour long videos in a single forward pass. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements (e.g., 45.3 vs 26.7 F1 score) over the state of the art on the recent VidChapters-7M benchmark. To promote further research, we release our code and models at our project page.

Title: Multi-Token Attention
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00927
Summary: Soft attention is a critical mechanism powering LLMs to locate relevant parts within a given context. However, individual attention weights are determined by the similarity of only a single query and key token vector. This "single token attention" bottlenecks the amount of information used in distinguishing a relevant part from the rest of the context. To address this issue, we propose a new attention method, Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows LLMs to condition their attention weights on multiple query and key vectors simultaneously. This is achieved by applying convolution operations over queries, keys and heads, allowing nearby queries and keys to affect each other's attention weights for more precise attention. As a result, our method can locate relevant context using richer, more nuanced information that can exceed a single vector's capacity. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that MTA achieves enhanced performance on a range of popular benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms Transformer baseline models on standard language modeling tasks, and on tasks that require searching for information within long contexts, where our method's ability to leverage richer information proves particularly beneficial.

Title: m1: Unleash the Potential of Test-Time Scaling for Medical Reasoning
  with Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00869
Summary: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, its effectiveness in medical reasoning remains uncertain, as the medical domain fundamentally differs from mathematical tasks in terms of knowledge representation and decision-making processes. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of test-time scaling for medical reasoning and present m1, a simple yet effective approach that increases a model's medical reasoning capability at inference. Our evaluation across diverse medical tasks demonstrates that test-time scaling consistently enhances medical reasoning, enabling lightweight fine-tuned models under 10B parameters to establish new state-of-the-art performance, while our 32B model rivals previous 70B-scale medical LLMs. However, we identify an optimal reasoning token budget of approximately 4K, beyond which performance may degrade due to overthinking. Budget forcing, which extends test-time computation through iterative prompts, helps models double-check answers but does not necessarily improve the overall medical QA performance and, in some cases, even introduces errors into previously correct responses. Our case-by-case analysis identifies insufficient medical knowledge as a key bottleneck that prevents further performance gains through test-time scaling. We find that increasing data scale, improving data quality, and expanding model capacity consistently enhance medical knowledge grounding, enabling continued performance improvements, particularly on challenging medical benchmarks where smaller models reach saturation. These findings underscore fundamental differences between medical and mathematical reasoning in LLMs, highlighting that enriched medical knowledge, other than increased reasoning depth alone, is essential for realizing the benefits of test-time scaling.

Title: Open-Qwen2VL: Compute-Efficient Pre-Training of Fully-Open Multimodal
  LLMs on Academic Resources
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00595
Summary: The reproduction of state-of-the-art multimodal LLM pre-training faces barriers at every stage of the pipeline, including high-quality data filtering, multimodal data mixture strategies, sequence packing techniques, and training frameworks. We introduce Open-Qwen2VL, a fully open-source 2B-parameter Multimodal Large Language Model pre-trained efficiently on 29M image-text pairs using only 442 A100-40G GPU hours. Our approach employs low-to-high dynamic image resolution and multimodal sequence packing to significantly enhance pre-training efficiency. The training dataset was carefully curated using both MLLM-based filtering techniques (e.g., MLM-Filter) and conventional CLIP-based filtering methods, substantially improving data quality and training efficiency. The Open-Qwen2VL pre-training is conducted on academic level 8xA100-40G GPUs at UCSB on 5B packed multimodal tokens, which is 0.36\% of 1.4T multimodal pre-training tokens of Qwen2-VL. The final instruction-tuned Open-Qwen2VL outperforms partially-open state-of-the-art MLLM Qwen2-VL-2B on various multimodal benchmarks of MMBench, SEEDBench, MMstar, and MathVista, indicating the remarkable training efficiency of Open-Qwen2VL. We open-source all aspects of our work, including compute-efficient and data-efficient training details, data filtering methods, sequence packing scripts, pre-training data in WebDataset format, FSDP-based training codebase, and both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints. We redefine "fully open" for multimodal LLMs as the complete release of: 1) the training codebase, 2) detailed data filtering techniques, and 3) all pre-training and supervised fine-tuning data used to develop the model.

Title: Z1: Efficient Test-time Scaling with Code
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00810
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve enhanced complex problem-solving through test-time computing scaling, yet this often entails longer contexts and numerous reasoning token costs. In this paper, we propose an efficient test-time scaling method that trains LLMs on code-related reasoning trajectories, facilitating their reduction of excess thinking tokens while maintaining performance. First, we create Z1-Code-Reasoning-107K, a curated dataset of simple and complex coding problems paired with their short and long solution trajectories. Second, we present a novel Shifted Thinking Window to mitigate overthinking overhead by removing context-delimiting tags (e.g., <think>. . . </think>) and capping reasoning tokens. Trained with long and short trajectory data and equipped with Shifted Thinking Window, our model, Z1-7B, demonstrates the ability to adjust its reasoning level as the complexity of problems and exhibits efficient test-time scaling across different reasoning tasks that matches R1-Distill-Qwen-7B performance with about 30% of its average thinking tokens. Notably, fine-tuned with only code trajectories, Z1-7B demonstrates generalization to broader reasoning tasks (47.5% on GPQA Diamond). Our analysis of efficient reasoning elicitation also provides valuable insights for future research.

Title: Recitation over Reasoning: How Cutting-Edge Language Models Can Fail on
  Elementary School-Level Reasoning Problems?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00509
Summary: The rapid escalation from elementary school-level to frontier problems of the difficulty for LLM benchmarks in recent years have weaved a miracle for researchers that we are only inches away from surpassing human intelligence. However, is the LLMs' remarkable reasoning ability indeed comes from true intelligence by human standards, or are they simply reciting solutions witnessed during training at an Internet level? To study this problem, we propose RoR-Bench, a novel, multi-modal benchmark for detecting LLM's recitation behavior when asked simple reasoning problems but with conditions subtly shifted, and conduct empirical analysis on our benchmark. Surprisingly, we found existing cutting-edge LLMs unanimously exhibits extremely severe recitation behavior; by changing one phrase in the condition, top models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 can suffer 60% performance loss on elementary school-level arithmetic and reasoning problems. Such findings are a wake-up call to the LLM community that compels us to re-evaluate the true intelligence level of cutting-edge LLMs.

Title: Inference-Time Scaling for Complex Tasks: Where We Stand and What Lies
  Ahead
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00294
Summary: Inference-time scaling can enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex problems that benefit from step-by-step problem solving. Although lengthening generated scratchpads has proven effective for mathematical tasks, the broader impact of this approach on other tasks remains less clear. In this work, we investigate the benefits and limitations of scaling methods across nine state-of-the-art models and eight challenging tasks, including math and STEM reasoning, calendar planning, NP-hard problems, navigation, and spatial reasoning. We compare conventional models (e.g., GPT-4o) with models fine-tuned for inference-time scaling (e.g., o1) through evaluation protocols that involve repeated model calls, either independently or sequentially with feedback. These evaluations approximate lower and upper performance bounds and potential for future performance improvements for each model, whether through enhanced training or multi-model inference systems. Our extensive empirical analysis reveals that the advantages of inference-time scaling vary across tasks and diminish as problem complexity increases. In addition, simply using more tokens does not necessarily translate to higher accuracy in these challenging regimes. Results from multiple independent runs with conventional models using perfect verifiers show that, for some tasks, these models can achieve performance close to the average performance of today's most advanced reasoning models. However, for other tasks, a significant performance gap remains, even in very high scaling regimes. Encouragingly, all models demonstrate significant gains when inference is further scaled with perfect verifiers or strong feedback, suggesting ample potential for future improvements.

Title: Efficient LLaMA-3.2-Vision by Trimming Cross-attended Visual Features
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00557
Summary: Visual token reduction lowers inference costs caused by extensive image features in large vision-language models (LVLMs). Unlike relevant studies that prune tokens in self-attention-only LVLMs, our work uniquely addresses cross-attention-based models, which achieve superior performance. We identify that the key-value (KV) cache size for image tokens in cross-attention layers significantly exceeds that of text tokens in self-attention layers, posing a major compute bottleneck. To mitigate this issue, we exploit the sparse nature in cross-attention maps to selectively prune redundant visual features. Our Trimmed Llama effectively reduces KV cache demands without requiring additional training. By benefiting from 50%-reduced visual features, our model can reduce inference latency and memory usage while achieving benchmark parity.

Title: Any2Caption:Interpreting Any Condition to Caption for Controllable Video
  Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24379
Summary: To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video quality across various aspects of existing video generation models.

Title: Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for
  Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24377
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field.

Title: Exploring the Effect of Reinforcement Learning on Video Understanding:
  Insights from SEED-Bench-R1
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24376
Summary: Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.

Title: AdaMMS: Model Merging for Heterogeneous Multimodal Large Language Models
  with Unsupervised Coefficient Optimization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23733
Summary: Recently, model merging methods have demonstrated powerful strengths in combining abilities on various tasks from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous model merging methods mainly focus on merging homogeneous models with identical architecture, they meet challenges when dealing with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with inherent heterogeneous property, including differences in model architecture and the asymmetry in the parameter space. In this work, we propose AdaMMS, a novel model merging method tailored for heterogeneous MLLMs. Our method tackles the challenges in three steps: mapping, merging and searching. Specifically, we first design mapping function between models to apply model merging on MLLMs with different architecture. Then we apply linear interpolation on model weights to actively adapt the asymmetry in the heterogeneous MLLMs. Finally in the hyper-parameter searching step, we propose an unsupervised hyper-parameter selection method for model merging. As the first model merging method capable of merging heterogeneous MLLMs without labeled data, extensive experiments on various model combinations demonstrated that AdaMMS outperforms previous model merging methods on various vision-language benchmarks.

Title: ManipTrans: Efficient Dexterous Bimanual Manipulation Transfer via
  Residual Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21860
Summary: Human hands play a central role in interacting, motivating increasing research in dexterous robotic manipulation. Data-driven embodied AI algorithms demand precise, large-scale, human-like manipulation sequences, which are challenging to obtain with conventional reinforcement learning or real-world teleoperation. To address this, we introduce ManipTrans, a novel two-stage method for efficiently transferring human bimanual skills to dexterous robotic hands in simulation. ManipTrans first pre-trains a generalist trajectory imitator to mimic hand motion, then fine-tunes a specific residual module under interaction constraints, enabling efficient learning and accurate execution of complex bimanual tasks. Experiments show that ManipTrans surpasses state-of-the-art methods in success rate, fidelity, and efficiency. Leveraging ManipTrans, we transfer multiple hand-object datasets to robotic hands, creating DexManipNet, a large-scale dataset featuring previously unexplored tasks like pen capping and bottle unscrewing. DexManipNet comprises 3.3K episodes of robotic manipulation and is easily extensible, facilitating further policy training for dexterous hands and enabling real-world deployments.

Title: GeometryCrafter: Consistent Geometry Estimation for Open-world Videos
  with Diffusion Priors
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01016
Summary: Despite remarkable advancements in video depth estimation, existing methods exhibit inherent limitations in achieving geometric fidelity through the affine-invariant predictions, limiting their applicability in reconstruction and other metrically grounded downstream tasks. We propose GeometryCrafter, a novel framework that recovers high-fidelity point map sequences with temporal coherence from open-world videos, enabling accurate 3D/4D reconstruction, camera parameter estimation, and other depth-based applications. At the core of our approach lies a point map Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a latent space agnostic to video latent distributions for effective point map encoding and decoding. Leveraging the VAE, we train a video diffusion model to model the distribution of point map sequences conditioned on the input videos. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate that GeometryCrafter achieves state-of-the-art 3D accuracy, temporal consistency, and generalization capability.

Title: When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and
  Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01005
Summary: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.

Title: Discovering Knowledge Deficiencies of Language Models on Massive
  Knowledge Base
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23361
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) possess impressive linguistic capabilities but often fail to faithfully retain factual knowledge, leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by exhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally prohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error ascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather than naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery as a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error candidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed failures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs hierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a relation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify systematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7x more knowledge errors than Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while reducing the cost-per-error by 599x and 9x, respectively. Human evaluation confirms the high quality of generated questions, while ablation and convergence analyses validate the contribution of each component in SEA. Further analysis on the discovered errors reveals correlated failure patterns across LLM families and recurring deficits, highlighting the need for better data coverage and targeted fine-tuning in future LLM development.
