Title: 3D Gaussian Editing with A Single Image
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07540
Summary: The modeling and manipulation of 3D scenes captured from the real world are pivotal in various applications, attracting growing research interest. While previous works on editing have achieved interesting results through manipulating 3D meshes, they often require accurately reconstructed meshes to perform editing, which limits their application in 3D content generation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel single-image-driven 3D scene editing approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, enabling intuitive manipulation via directly editing the content on a 2D image plane. Our method learns to optimize the 3D Gaussians to align with an edited version of the image rendered from a user-specified viewpoint of the original scene. To capture long-range object deformation, we introduce positional loss into the optimization process of 3D Gaussian Splatting and enable gradient propagation through reparameterization. To handle occluded 3D Gaussians when rendering from the specified viewpoint, we build an anchor-based structure and employ a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy capable of handling long-range deformation while maintaining structural stability. Furthermore, we design a novel masking strategy to adaptively identify non-rigid deformation regions for fine-scale modeling. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method in handling geometric details, long-range, and non-rigid deformation, demonstrating superior editing flexibility and quality compared to previous approaches.

Title: PeriodWave: Multi-Period Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07547
Summary: Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. Although GAN-based methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage text-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all, there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields. Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to capture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires more computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by period-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the high-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental results demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks. All source code will be available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/PeriodWave.

Title: Rethinking Open-Vocabulary Segmentation of Radiance Fields in 3D Space
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07416
Summary: Understanding the 3D semantics of a scene is a fundamental problem for various scenarios such as embodied agents. While NeRFs and 3DGS excel at novel-view synthesis, previous methods for understanding their semantics have been limited to incomplete 3D understanding: their segmentation results are 2D masks and their supervision is anchored at 2D pixels. This paper revisits the problem set to pursue a better 3D understanding of a scene modeled by NeRFs and 3DGS as follows. 1) We directly supervise the 3D points to train the language embedding field. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy without relying on multi-scale language embeddings. 2) We transfer the pre-trained language field to 3DGS, achieving the first real-time rendering speed without sacrificing training time or accuracy. 3) We introduce a 3D querying and evaluation protocol for assessing the reconstructed geometry and semantics together. Code, checkpoints, and annotations will be available online. Project page: https://hyunji12.github.io/Open3DRF

Title: Aquila2 Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07410
Summary: This paper introduces the Aquila2 series, which comprises a wide range of bilingual models with parameter sizes of 7, 34, and 70 billion. These models are trained based on an innovative framework named HeuriMentor (HM), which offers real-time insights into model convergence and enhances the training process and data management. The HM System, comprising the Adaptive Training Engine (ATE), Training State Monitor (TSM), and Data Management Unit (DMU), allows for precise monitoring of the model's training progress and enables efficient optimization of data distribution, thereby enhancing training effectiveness.

Title: Generative Photomontage
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07116
Summary: Text-to-image models are powerful tools for image creation. However, the generation process is akin to a dice roll and makes it difficult to achieve a single image that captures everything a user wants. In this paper, we propose a framework for creating the desired image by compositing it from various parts of generated images, in essence forming a Generative Photomontage. Given a stack of images generated by ControlNet using the same input condition and different seeds, we let users select desired parts from the generated results using a brush stroke interface. We introduce a novel technique that takes in the user's brush strokes, segments the generated images using a graph-based optimization in diffusion feature space, and then composites the segmented regions via a new feature-space blending method. Our method faithfully preserves the user-selected regions while compositing them harmoniously. We demonstrate that our flexible framework can be used for many applications, including generating new appearance combinations, fixing incorrect shapes and artifacts, and improving prompt alignment. We show compelling results for each application and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing image blending methods and various baselines.

Title: InfinityMATH: A Scalable Instruction Tuning Dataset in Programmatic Mathematical Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07089
Summary: Recent advancements in Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) and Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) methods have greatly enhanced language models' mathematical reasoning capabilities, facilitating their integration into instruction tuning datasets with LLMs. However, existing methods for large-scale dataset creation require substantial seed data and high computational costs for data synthesis, posing significant challenges for scalability. We introduce InfinityMATH, a scalable instruction tuning dataset for programmatic mathematical reasoning. The construction pipeline emphasizes decoupling numbers from mathematical problems to synthesize number-independent programs, enabling efficient and flexible scaling while minimizing dependency on specific numerical values. Fine-tuning experiments with open-source language and code models, such as Llama2 and CodeLlama, demonstrate the practical benefits of InfinityMATH. These fine-tuned models, showed significant relative improvements on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, ranging from 184.7% to 514.3% on average. Additionally, these models exhibited high robustness on the GSM8K+ and MATH+ benchmarks, which are enhanced version of test sets with simply the number variations. InfinityMATH ensures that models are more versatile and effective across a broader range of mathematical problems. The data is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/flagopen/InfinityMATH.

Title: Diversity Empowers Intelligence: Integrating Expertise of Software Engineering Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07060
Summary: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in solving real-world software engineering (SWE) problems. The most advanced open-source SWE agent can resolve over 27% of real GitHub issues in SWE-Bench Lite. However, these sophisticated agent frameworks exhibit varying strengths, excelling in certain tasks while underperforming in others. To fully harness the diversity of these agents, we propose DEI (Diversity Empowered Intelligence), a framework that leverages their unique expertise. DEI functions as a meta-module atop existing SWE agent frameworks, managing agent collectives for enhanced problem-solving. Experimental results show that a DEI-guided committee of agents is able to surpass the best individual agent's performance by a large margin. For instance, a group of open-source SWE agents, with a maximum individual resolve rate of 27.3% on SWE-Bench Lite, can achieve a 34.3% resolve rate with DEI, making a 25% improvement and beating most closed-source solutions. Our best-performing group excels with a 55% resolve rate, securing the highest ranking on SWE-Bench Lite. Our findings contribute to the growing body of research on collaborative AI systems and their potential to solve complex software engineering challenges.

Title: ZePo: Zero-Shot Portrait Stylization with Faster Sampling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05492
Summary: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have significantly advanced the field of art content synthesis. However, current portrait stylization methods generally require either model fine-tuning based on examples or the employment of DDIM Inversion to revert images to noise space, both of which substantially decelerate the image generation process. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents an inversion-free portrait stylization framework based on diffusion models that accomplishes content and style feature fusion in merely four sampling steps. We observed that Latent Consistency Models employing consistency distillation can effectively extract representative Consistency Features from noisy images. To blend the Consistency Features extracted from both content and style images, we introduce a Style Enhancement Attention Control technique that meticulously merges content and style features within the attention space of the target image. Moreover, we propose a feature merging strategy to amalgamate redundant features in Consistency Features, thereby reducing the computational load of attention control. Extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework in enhancing stylization efficiency and fidelity. The code is available at https://github.com/liujin112/ZePo.

Title: Adapting General Disentanglement-Based Speaker Anonymization for Enhanced Emotion Preservation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05928
Summary: A general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system typically separates speech into content, speaker, and prosody features using individual encoders. This paper explores how to adapt such a system when a new speech attribute, for example, emotion, needs to be preserved to a greater extent. While existing systems are good at anonymizing speaker embeddings, they are not designed to preserve emotion. Two strategies for this are examined. First, we show that integrating emotion embeddings from a pre-trained emotion encoder can help preserve emotional cues, even though this approach slightly compromises privacy protection. Alternatively, we propose an emotion compensation strategy as a post-processing step applied to anonymized speaker embeddings. This conceals the original speaker's identity and reintroduces the emotional traits lost during speaker embedding anonymization. Specifically, we model the emotion attribute using support vector machines to learn separate boundaries for each emotion. During inference, the original speaker embedding is processed in two ways: one, by an emotion indicator to predict emotion and select the emotion-matched SVM accurately; and two, by a speaker anonymizer to conceal speaker characteristics. The anonymized speaker embedding is then modified along the corresponding SVM boundary towards an enhanced emotional direction to save the emotional cues. The proposed strategies are also expected to be useful for adapting a general disentanglement-based speaker anonymization system to preserve other target paralinguistic attributes, with potential for a range of downstream tasks.

Title: Design Proteins Using Large Language Models: Enhancements and Comparative Analyses
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06396
Summary: Pre-trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high-quality protein sequences. Specifically, we adopt a suite of pre-trained LLMs, including Mistral-7B1, Llama-2-7B2, Llama-3-8B3, and gemma-7B4, to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available.5 Unlike previous work in this field, our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42,000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein-related data, ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data, the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein-focused models such as ProGen varieties, ProtGPT2, and ProLLaMA, which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models, we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT, RMSD, TM-score, and REU. Furthermore, we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available, fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.

Title: FuxiTranyu: A Multilingual Large Language Model Trained with Balanced Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06273
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in a wide range of tasks. However, many LLMs exhibit significant performance discrepancies between high- and low-resource languages. To mitigate this challenge, we present FuxiTranyu, an open-source multilingual LLM, which is designed to satisfy the need of the research community for balanced and high-performing multilingual capabilities. FuxiTranyu-8B, the base model with 8 billion parameters, is trained from scratch on a meticulously balanced multilingual data repository that contains 600 billion tokens covering 43 natural languages and 16 programming languages. In addition to the base model, we also develop two instruction-tuned models: FuxiTranyu-8B-SFT that is fine-tuned on a diverse multilingual instruction dataset, and FuxiTranyu-8B-DPO that is further refined with DPO on a preference dataset for enhanced alignment ability. Extensive experiments on a wide range of multilingual benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of FuxiTranyu against existing multilingual LLMs, e.g., BLOOM-7B, PolyLM-13B, Llama-2-Chat-7B and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Interpretability analyses at both the neuron and representation level suggest that FuxiTranyu is able to learn consistent multilingual representations across different languages. To promote further research into multilingual LLMs and their working mechanisms, we release both the base and instruction-tuned FuxiTranyu models together with 58 pretraining checkpoints at HuggingFace and Github.

Title: Amuro & Char: Analyzing the Relationship between Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06663
Summary: The development of large language models leads to the formation of a pre-train-then-align paradigm, in which the model is typically pre-trained on a large text corpus and undergoes a tuning stage to align the model with human preference or downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.

Title: MovieSum: An Abstractive Summarization Dataset for Movie Screenplays
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06281
Summary: Movie screenplay summarization is challenging, as it requires an understanding of long input contexts and various elements unique to movies. Large language models have shown significant advancements in document summarization, but they often struggle with processing long input contexts. Furthermore, while television transcripts have received attention in recent studies, movie screenplay summarization remains underexplored. To stimulate research in this area, we present a new dataset, MovieSum, for abstractive summarization of movie screenplays. This dataset comprises 2200 movie screenplays accompanied by their Wikipedia plot summaries. We manually formatted the movie screenplays to represent their structural elements. Compared to existing datasets, MovieSum possesses several distinctive features: (1) It includes movie screenplays, which are longer than scripts of TV episodes. (2) It is twice the size of previous movie screenplay datasets. (3) It provides metadata with IMDb IDs to facilitate access to additional external knowledge. We also show the results of recently released large language models applied to summarization on our dataset to provide a detailed baseline.

Title: Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06793
Summary: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized their capabilities in various tasks, yet this growth must be matched with efficient computational strategies. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information, potentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains to its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert selection and diversity. Our code is at https://github.com/qiuzh20/RMoE

Title: SlotLifter: Slot-guided Feature Lifting for Learning Object-centric Radiance Fields
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06697
Summary: The ability to distill object-centric abstractions from intricate visual scenes underpins human-level generalization. Despite the significant progress in object-centric learning methods, learning object-centric representations in the 3D physical world remains a crucial challenge. In this work, we propose SlotLifter, a novel object-centric radiance model addressing scene reconstruction and decomposition jointly via slot-guided feature lifting. Such a design unites object-centric learning representations and image-based rendering methods, offering state-of-the-art performance in scene decomposition and novel-view synthesis on four challenging synthetic and four complex real-world datasets, outperforming existing 3D object-centric learning methods by a large margin. Through extensive ablative studies, we showcase the efficacy of designs in SlotLifter, revealing key insights for potential future directions.

Title: TacSL: A Library for Visuotactile Sensor Simulation and Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06506
Summary: For both humans and robots, the sense of touch, known as tactile sensing, is critical for performing contact-rich manipulation tasks. Three key challenges in robotic tactile sensing are 1) interpreting sensor signals, 2) generating sensor signals in novel scenarios, and 3) learning sensor-based policies. For visuotactile sensors, interpretation has been facilitated by their close relationship with vision sensors (e.g., RGB cameras). However, generation is still difficult, as visuotactile sensors typically involve contact, deformation, illumination, and imaging, all of which are expensive to simulate; in turn, policy learning has been challenging, as simulation cannot be leveraged for large-scale data collection. We present TacSL (taxel), a library for GPU-based visuotactile sensor simulation and learning. TacSL can be used to simulate visuotactile images and extract contact-force distributions over 200times faster than the prior state-of-the-art, all within the widely-used Isaac Gym simulator. Furthermore, TacSL provides a learning toolkit containing multiple sensor models, contact-intensive training environments, and online/offline algorithms that can facilitate policy learning for sim-to-real applications. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a novel online reinforcement-learning algorithm called asymmetric actor-critic distillation (\sysName), designed to effectively and efficiently learn tactile-based policies in simulation that can transfer to the real world. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our library and algorithms by evaluating the benefits of distillation and multimodal sensing for contact-rich manip ulation tasks, and most critically, performing sim-to-real transfer.

Title: UniT: Unified Tactile Representation for Robot Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06481
Summary: UniT is a novel approach to tactile representation learning, using VQVAE to learn a compact latent space and serve as the tactile representation. It uses tactile images obtained from a single simple object to train the representation with transferability and generalizability. This tactile representation can be zero-shot transferred to various downstream tasks, including perception tasks and manipulation policy learning. Our benchmarking on an in-hand 3D pose estimation task shows that UniT outperforms existing visual and tactile representation learning methods. Additionally, UniT's effectiveness in policy learning is demonstrated across three real-world tasks involving diverse manipulated objects and complex robot-object-environment interactions. Through extensive experimentation, UniT is shown to be a simple-to-train, plug-and-play, yet widely effective method for tactile representation learning.

Title: DC3DO: Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06693
Summary: Inspired by Geoffrey Hinton emphasis on generative modeling, To recognize shapes, first learn to generate them, we explore the use of 3D diffusion models for object classification. Leveraging the density estimates from these models, our approach, the Diffusion Classifier for 3D Objects (DC3DO), enables zero-shot classification of 3D shapes without additional training. On average, our method achieves a 12.5 percent improvement compared to its multiview counterparts, demonstrating superior multimodal reasoning over discriminative approaches. DC3DO employs a class-conditional diffusion model trained on ShapeNet, and we run inferences on point clouds of chairs and cars. This work highlights the potential of generative models in 3D object classification.

Title: LongWriter: Unleashing 10,000+ Word Generation from Long Context LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07055
Summary: Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words. Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets. To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models. In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability.

Title: Your Context Is Not an Array: Unveiling Random Access Limitations in Transformers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05506
Summary: Despite their recent successes, Transformer-based large language models show surprising failure modes. A well-known example of such failure modes is their inability to length-generalize: solving problem instances at inference time that are longer than those seen during training. In this work, we further explore the root cause of this failure by performing a detailed analysis of model behaviors on the simple parity task. Our analysis suggests that length generalization failures are intricately related to a model's inability to perform random memory accesses within its context window. We present supporting evidence for this hypothesis by demonstrating the effectiveness of methodologies that circumvent the need for indexing or that enable random token access indirectly, through content-based addressing. We further show where and how the failure to perform random memory access manifests through attention map visualizations.

Title: VisualAgentBench: Towards Large Multimodal Models as Visual Foundation Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06327
Summary: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have ushered in a new era in artificial intelligence, merging capabilities in both language and vision to form highly capable Visual Foundation Agents. These agents are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks, potentially approaching general artificial intelligence. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and pioneering benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across nine proprietary LMM APIs and eight open models, we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB constructs a trajectory training set constructed through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, promoting substantial performance improvements in LMMs through behavior cloning. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides a solid foundation for future development into visual foundation agents. Code, train \& test data, and part of fine-tuned open LMMs are available at https://github.com/THUDM/VisualAgentBench.

Title: Body Transformer: Leveraging Robot Embodiment for Policy Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06316
Summary: In recent years, the transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for machine learning algorithms applied to natural language processing and computer vision. Despite notable evidence of successful deployment of this architecture in the context of robot learning, we claim that vanilla transformers do not fully exploit the structure of the robot learning problem. Therefore, we propose Body Transformer (BoT), an architecture that leverages the robot embodiment by providing an inductive bias that guides the learning process. We represent the robot body as a graph of sensors and actuators, and rely on masked attention to pool information throughout the architecture. The resulting architecture outperforms the vanilla transformer, as well as the classical multilayer perceptron, in terms of task completion, scaling properties, and computational efficiency when representing either imitation or reinforcement learning policies. Additional material including the open-source code is available at https://sferrazza.cc/bot_site.

Title: Mutual Reasoning Makes Smaller LLMs Stronger Problem-Solvers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06195
Summary: This paper introduces rStar, a self-play mutual reasoning approach that significantly improves reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) without fine-tuning or superior models. rStar decouples reasoning into a self-play mutual generation-discrimination process. First, a target SLM augments the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a rich set of human-like reasoning actions to construct higher quality reasoning trajectories. Next, another SLM, with capabilities similar to the target SLM, acts as a discriminator to verify each trajectory generated by the target SLM. The mutually agreed reasoning trajectories are considered mutual consistent, thus are more likely to be correct. Extensive experiments across five SLMs demonstrate rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems, including GSM8K, GSM-Hard, MATH, SVAMP, and StrategyQA. Remarkably, rStar boosts GSM8K accuracy from 12.51% to 63.91% for LLaMA2-7B, from 36.46% to 81.88% for Mistral-7B, from 74.53% to 91.13% for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct.

Title: FruitNeRF: A Unified Neural Radiance Field based Fruit Counting Framework
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06190
Summary: We introduce FruitNeRF, a unified novel fruit counting framework that leverages state-of-the-art view synthesis methods to count any fruit type directly in 3D. Our framework takes an unordered set of posed images captured by a monocular camera and segments fruit in each image. To make our system independent of the fruit type, we employ a foundation model that generates binary segmentation masks for any fruit. Utilizing both modalities, RGB and semantic, we train a semantic neural radiance field. Through uniform volume sampling of the implicit Fruit Field, we obtain fruit-only point clouds. By applying cascaded clustering on the extracted point cloud, our approach achieves precise fruit count.The use of neural radiance fields provides significant advantages over conventional methods such as object tracking or optical flow, as the counting itself is lifted into 3D. Our method prevents double counting fruit and avoids counting irrelevant fruit.We evaluate our methodology using both real-world and synthetic datasets. The real-world dataset consists of three apple trees with manually counted ground truths, a benchmark apple dataset with one row and ground truth fruit location, while the synthetic dataset comprises various fruit types including apple, plum, lemon, pear, peach, and mango.Additionally, we assess the performance of fruit counting using the foundation model compared to a U-Net.

Summary: Med42-v2 introduces a suite of clinical large language models (LLMs) designed to address the limitations of generic models in healthcare settings. These models are built on Llama3 architecture and fine-tuned using specialized clinical data. They underwent multi-stage preference alignment to effectively respond to natural prompts. While generic models are often preference-aligned to avoid answering clinical queries as a precaution, Med42-v2 is specifically trained to overcome this limitation, enabling its use in clinical settings. Med42-v2 models demonstrate superior performance compared to the original Llama3 models in both 8B and 70B parameter configurations and GPT-4 across various medical benchmarks. These LLMs are developed to understand clinical queries, perform reasoning tasks, and provide valuable assistance in clinical environments. The models are now publicly available at https://huggingface.co/m42-health{https://huggingface.co/m42-health}.

Title: CogVideoX: Text-to-Video Diffusion Models with An Expert Transformer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06072
Summary: We introduce CogVideoX, a large-scale diffusion transformer model designed for generating videos based on text prompts. To efficently model video data, we propose to levearge a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and temporal dimensions. To improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the two modalities. By employing a progressive training technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method. It significantly helps enhance the performance of CogVideoX, improving both generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple machine metrics and human evaluations. The model weights of both the 3D Causal VAE and CogVideoX are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/CogVideo.

Title: HeadGAP: Few-shot 3D Head Avatar via Generalizable Gaussian Priors
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06019
Summary: In this paper, we present a novel 3D head avatar creation approach capable of generalizing from few-shot in-the-wild data with high-fidelity and animatable robustness. Given the underconstrained nature of this problem, incorporating prior knowledge is essential. Therefore, we propose a framework comprising prior learning and avatar creation phases. The prior learning phase leverages 3D head priors derived from a large-scale multi-view dynamic dataset, and the avatar creation phase applies these priors for few-shot personalization. Our approach effectively captures these priors by utilizing a Gaussian Splatting-based auto-decoder network with part-based dynamic modeling. Our method employs identity-shared encoding with personalized latent codes for individual identities to learn the attributes of Gaussian primitives. During the avatar creation phase, we achieve fast head avatar personalization by leveraging inversion and fine-tuning strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model effectively exploits head priors and successfully generalizes them to few-shot personalization, achieving photo-realistic rendering quality, multi-view consistency, and stable animation.

Title: UniPortrait: A Unified Framework for Identity-Preserving Single- and Multi-Human Image Personalization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05939
Summary: This paper presents UniPortrait, an innovative human image personalization framework that unifies single- and multi-ID customization with high face fidelity, extensive facial editability, free-form input description, and diverse layout generation. UniPortrait consists of only two plug-and-play modules: an ID embedding module and an ID routing module. The ID embedding module extracts versatile editable facial features with a decoupling strategy for each ID and embeds them into the context space of diffusion models. The ID routing module then combines and distributes these embeddings adaptively to their respective regions within the synthesized image, achieving the customization of single and multiple IDs. With a carefully designed two-stage training scheme, UniPortrait achieves superior performance in both single- and multi-ID customization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing approaches as well as its good scalability, e.g., the universal compatibility with existing generative control tools.

Title: ControlNeXt: Powerful and Efficient Control for Image and Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06070
Summary: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable and robust abilities in both image and video generation. To achieve greater control over generated results, researchers introduce additional architectures, such as ControlNet, Adapters and ReferenceNet, to integrate conditioning controls. However, current controllable generation methods often require substantial additional computational resources, especially for video generation, and face challenges in training or exhibit weak control. In this paper, we propose ControlNeXt: a powerful and efficient method for controllable image and video generation. We first design a more straightforward and efficient architecture, replacing heavy additional branches with minimal additional cost compared to the base model. Such a concise structure also allows our method to seamlessly integrate with other LoRA weights, enabling style alteration without the need for additional training. As for training, we reduce up to 90% of learnable parameters compared to the alternatives. Furthermore, we propose another method called Cross Normalization (CN) as a replacement for Zero-Convolution' to achieve fast and stable training convergence. We have conducted various experiments with different base models across images and videos, demonstrating the robustness of our method.

Title: The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06292
Summary: One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge. While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

Title: BRAT: Bonus oRthogonAl Token for Architecture Agnostic Textual Inversion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04785
Summary: Textual Inversion remains a popular method for personalizing diffusion models, in order to teach models new subjects and styles. We note that textual inversion has been underexplored using alternatives to the UNet, and experiment with textual inversion with a vision transformer. We also seek to optimize textual inversion using a strategy that does not require explicit use of the UNet and its idiosyncratic layers, so we add bonus tokens and enforce orthogonality. We find the use of the bonus token improves adherence to the source images and the use of the vision transformer improves adherence to the prompt. Code is available at https://github.com/jamesBaker361/tex_inv_plus.

Title: Generating novel experimental hypotheses from language models: A case study on cross-dative generalization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05086
Summary: Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me) -- acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual features -- using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask: "what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?" To answer this, we systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs' usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the exposure context -- in particular, its first postverbal argument -- are harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test this hypothesis in children.

Title: MooER: LLM-based Speech Recognition and Translation Models from Moore Threads
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05101
Summary: In this paper, we present MooER, a LLM-based large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) / automatic speech translation (AST) model of Moore Threads. A 5000h pseudo labeled dataset containing open source and self collected speech data is used for training. We achieve performance comparable to other open source models trained with up to hundreds of thousands of hours of labeled speech data. Meanwhile, experiments conducted on Covost2 Zh2en testset suggest that our model outperforms other open source Speech LLMs. A BLEU score of 25.2 can be obtained. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows. First, this paper presents a training strategy for encoders and LLMs on speech related tasks (including ASR and AST) using a small size of pseudo labeled data without any extra manual annotation and selection. Second, we release our ASR and AST models and plan to open-source our training code and strategy in the near future. Moreover, a model trained on 8wh scale training data is planned to be released later on.

Title: mPLUG-Owl3: Towards Long Image-Sequence Understanding in Multi-Modal Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04840
Summary: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in executing instructions for a variety of single-image tasks. Despite this progress, significant challenges remain in modeling long image sequences. In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language model, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence understanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge, interleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel hyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a common language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of extended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that mPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar size on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a challenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to assess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally, with the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance on ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to the development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language models.

Title: VITA: Towards Open-Source Interactive Omni Multimodal LLM
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05211
Summary: The remarkable multimodal capabilities and interactive experience of GPT-4o underscore their necessity in practical applications, yet open-source models rarely excel in both areas. In this paper, we introduce VITA, the first-ever open-source Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) adept at simultaneous processing and analysis of Video, Image, Text, and Audio modalities, and meanwhile has an advanced multimodal interactive experience. Starting from Mixtral 8x7B as a language foundation, we expand its Chinese vocabulary followed by bilingual instruction tuning. We further endow the language model with visual and audio capabilities through two-stage multi-task learning of multimodal alignment and instruction tuning. VITA demonstrates robust foundational capabilities of multilingual, vision, and audio understanding, as evidenced by its strong performance across a range of both unimodal and multimodal benchmarks. Beyond foundational capabilities, we have made considerable progress in enhancing the natural multimodal human-computer interaction experience. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit non-awakening interaction and audio interrupt in MLLM. VITA is the first step for the open-source community to explore the seamless integration of multimodal understanding and interaction. While there is still lots of work to be done on VITA to get close to close-source counterparts, we hope that its role as a pioneer can serve as a cornerstone for subsequent research.

Title: Kalman-Inspired Feature Propagation for Video Face Super-Resolution
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05205
Summary: Despite the promising progress of face image super-resolution, video face super-resolution remains relatively under-explored. Existing approaches either adapt general video super-resolution networks to face datasets or apply established face image super-resolution models independently on individual video frames. These paradigms encounter challenges either in reconstructing facial details or maintaining temporal consistency. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework called Kalman-inspired Feature Propagation (KEEP), designed to maintain a stable face prior over time. The Kalman filtering principles offer our method a recurrent ability to use the information from previously restored frames to guide and regulate the restoration process of the current frame. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in capturing facial details consistently across video frames. Code and video demo are available at https://jnjaby.github.io/projects/KEEP.

Title: Gemma Scope: Open Sparse Autoencoders Everywhere All At Once on Gemma 2
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05147
Summary: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an unsupervised method for learning a sparse decomposition of a neural network's latent representations into seemingly interpretable features. Despite recent excitement about their potential, research applications outside of industry are limited by the high cost of training a comprehensive suite of SAEs. In this work, we introduce Gemma Scope, an open suite of JumpReLU SAEs trained on all layers and sub-layers of Gemma 2 2B and 9B and select layers of Gemma 2 27B base models. We primarily train SAEs on the Gemma 2 pre-trained models, but additionally release SAEs trained on instruction-tuned Gemma 2 9B for comparison. We evaluate the quality of each SAE on standard metrics and release these results. We hope that by releasing these SAE weights, we can help make more ambitious safety and interpretability research easier for the community.

Title: MulliVC: Multi-lingual Voice Conversion With Cycle Consistency
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04708
Summary: Voice conversion aims to modify the source speaker's voice to resemble the target speaker while preserving the original speech content. Despite notable advancements in voice conversion these days, multi-lingual voice conversion (including both monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios) has yet to be extensively studied. It faces two main challenges: 1) the considerable variability in prosody and articulation habits across languages; and 2) the rarity of paired multi-lingual datasets from the same speaker. In this paper, we propose MulliVC, a novel voice conversion system that only converts timbre and keeps original content and source language prosody without multi-lingual paired data. Specifically, each training step of MulliVC contains three substeps: In step one the model is trained with monolingual speech data; then, steps two and three take inspiration from back translation, construct a cyclical process to disentangle the timbre and other information (content, prosody, and other language-related information) in the absence of multi-lingual data from the same speaker. Both objective and subjective results indicate that MulliVC significantly surpasses other methods in both monolingual and cross-lingual contexts, demonstrating the system's efficacy and the viability of the three-step approach with cycle consistency. Audio samples can be found on our demo page (mullivc.github.io).

Title: UniBench: Visual Reasoning Requires Rethinking Vision-Language Beyond Scaling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04810
Summary: Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks, researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress. To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a comprehensive range of carefully categorized capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations. Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU.

Title: ToolSandbox: A Stateful, Conversational, Interactive Evaluation Benchmark for LLM Tool Use Capabilities
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04682
Summary: Recent large language models (LLMs) advancements sparked a growing research interest in tool assisted LLMs solving real-world challenges, which calls for comprehensive evaluation of tool-use capabilities. While previous works focused on either evaluating over stateless web services (RESTful API), based on a single turn user prompt, or an off-policy dialog trajectory, ToolSandbox includes stateful tool execution, implicit state dependencies between tools, a built-in user simulator supporting on-policy conversational evaluation and a dynamic evaluation strategy for intermediate and final milestones over an arbitrary trajectory. We show that open source and proprietary models have a significant performance gap, and complex tasks like State Dependency, Canonicalization and Insufficient Information defined in ToolSandbox are challenging even the most capable SOTA LLMs, providing brand-new insights into tool-use LLM capabilities. ToolSandbox evaluation framework is released at https://github.com/apple/ToolSandbox

Title: VGGHeads: A Large-Scale Synthetic Dataset for 3D Human Heads
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18245
Summary: Human head detection, keypoint estimation, and 3D head model fitting are important tasks with many applications. However, traditional real-world datasets often suffer from bias, privacy, and ethical concerns, and they have been recorded in laboratory environments, which makes it difficult for trained models to generalize. Here, we introduce VGGHeads -- a large scale synthetic dataset generated with diffusion models for human head detection and 3D mesh estimation. Our dataset comprises over 1 million high-resolution images, each annotated with detailed 3D head meshes, facial landmarks, and bounding boxes. Using this dataset we introduce a new model architecture capable of simultaneous heads detection and head meshes reconstruction from a single image in a single step. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong performance on real images. Furthermore, the versatility of our dataset makes it applicable across a broad spectrum of tasks, offering a general and comprehensive representation of human heads. Additionally, we provide detailed information about the synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling it to be re-used for other tasks and domains.

Title: Learning Task Decomposition to Assist Humans in Competitive Programming
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04604
Summary: When using language models (LMs) to solve complex problems, humans might struggle to understand the LM-generated solutions and repair the flawed ones. To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.

Title: Learning to Predict Program Execution by Modeling Dynamic Dependency on Code Graphs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02816
Summary: Predicting program behavior without execution is an essential and challenging task in software engineering. Traditional models often struggle to capture dynamic dependencies and interactions within code. This paper introduces a novel machine learning-based framework called CodeFlowrepresents, which predicts code coverage and detects runtime errors through Dynamic Dependencies Learning. Utilizing control flow graphs (CFGs), CodeFlowrepresents all possible execution paths and the relationships between different statements, offering a comprehensive understanding of program behavior. It constructs CFGs to depict execution paths and learns vector representations for CFG nodes, capturing static control-flow dependencies. Additionally, it learns dynamic dependencies through execution traces, which reflect the impacts among statements during execution. This approach enables accurate prediction of code coverage and identification of runtime errors. Empirical evaluations show significant improvements in code coverage prediction accuracy and effective localization of runtime errors, surpassing current models.

Title: Advancing Molecular Machine (Learned) Representations with Stereoelectronics-Infused Molecular Graphs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04520
Summary: Molecular representation is a foundational element in our understanding of the physical world. Its importance ranges from the fundamentals of chemical reactions to the design of new therapies and materials. Previous molecular machine learning models have employed strings, fingerprints, global features, and simple molecular graphs that are inherently information-sparse representations. However, as the complexity of prediction tasks increases, the molecular representation needs to encode higher fidelity information. This work introduces a novel approach to infusing quantum-chemical-rich information into molecular graphs via stereoelectronic effects. We show that the explicit addition of stereoelectronic interactions significantly improves the performance of molecular machine learning models. Furthermore, stereoelectronics-infused representations can be learned and deployed with a tailored double graph neural network workflow, enabling its application to any downstream molecular machine learning task. Finally, we show that the learned representations allow for facile stereoelectronic evaluation of previously intractable systems, such as entire proteins, opening new avenues of molecular design.

Title: Trans-Tokenization and Cross-lingual Vocabulary Transfers: Language Adaptation of LLMs for Low-Resource NLP
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04303
Summary: The development of monolingual language models for low and mid-resource languages continues to be hindered by the difficulty in sourcing high-quality training data. In this study, we present a novel cross-lingual vocabulary transfer strategy, trans-tokenization, designed to tackle this challenge and enable more efficient language adaptation. Our approach focuses on adapting a high-resource monolingual LLM to an unseen target language by initializing the token embeddings of the target language using a weighted average of semantically similar token embeddings from the source language. For this, we leverage a translation resource covering both the source and target languages. We validate our method with the Tweeties, a series of trans-tokenized LLMs, and demonstrate their competitive performance on various downstream tasks across a small but diverse set of languages. Additionally, we introduce Hydra LLMs, models with multiple swappable language modeling heads and embedding tables, which further extend the capabilities of our trans-tokenization strategy. By designing a Hydra LLM based on the multilingual model TowerInstruct, we developed a state-of-the-art machine translation model for Tatar, in a zero-shot manner, completely bypassing the need for high-quality parallel data. This breakthrough is particularly significant for low-resource languages like Tatar, where high-quality parallel data is hard to come by. By lowering the data and time requirements for training high-quality models, our trans-tokenization strategy allows for the development of LLMs for a wider range of languages, especially those with limited resources. We hope that our work will inspire further research and collaboration in the field of cross-lingual vocabulary transfer and contribute to the empowerment of languages on a global scale.
