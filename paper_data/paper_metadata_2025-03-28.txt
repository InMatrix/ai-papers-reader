Title: RecTable: Fast Modeling Tabular Data with Rectified Flow
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20731
Summary: Score-based or diffusion models generate high-quality tabular data, surpassing GAN-based and VAE-based models. However, these methods require substantial training time. In this paper, we introduce RecTable, which uses the rectified flow modeling, applied in such as text-to-image generation and text-to-video generation. RecTable features a simple architecture consisting of a few stacked gated linear unit blocks. Additionally, our training strategies are also simple, incorporating a mixed-type noise distribution and a logit-normal timestep distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that RecTable achieves competitive performance compared to the several state-of-the-art diffusion and score-based models while reducing the required training time. Our code is available at https://github.com/fmp453/rectable.

Title: Gemma 3 Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19786
Summary: We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.

Title: Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning
  for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18929
Summary: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.

Title: RONA: Pragmatically Diverse Image Captioning with Coherence Relations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10997
Summary: Writing Assistants (e.g., Grammarly, Microsoft Copilot) traditionally generate diverse image captions by employing syntactic and semantic variations to describe image components. However, human-written captions prioritize conveying a central message alongside visual descriptions using pragmatic cues. To enhance pragmatic diversity, it is essential to explore alternative ways of communicating these messages in conjunction with visual content. To address this challenge, we propose RONA, a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLM) that leverages Coherence Relations as an axis for variation. We demonstrate that RONA generates captions with better overall diversity and ground-truth alignment, compared to MLLM baselines across multiple domains. Our code is available at: https://github.com/aashish2000/RONA

Title: Unlocking Efficient Long-to-Short LLM Reasoning with Model Merging
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20641
Summary: The transition from System 1 to System 2 reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has marked significant advancements in handling complex tasks through deliberate, iterative thinking. However, this progress often comes at the cost of efficiency, as models tend to overthink, generating redundant reasoning steps without proportional improvements in output quality. Long-to-Short (L2S) reasoning has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, aiming to balance reasoning depth with practical efficiency. While existing approaches, such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and prompt engineering, have shown potential, they are either computationally expensive or unstable. Model merging, on the other hand, offers a cost-effective and robust alternative by integrating the quick-thinking capabilities of System 1 models with the methodical reasoning of System 2 models. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study on model merging for L2S reasoning, exploring diverse methodologies, including task-vector-based, SVD-based, and activation-informed merging. Our experiments reveal that model merging can reduce average response length by up to 55% while preserving or even improving baseline performance. We also identify a strong correlation between model scale and merging efficacy with extensive evaluations on 1.5B/7B/14B/32B models. Furthermore, we investigate the merged model's ability to self-critique and self-correct, as well as its adaptive response length based on task complexity. Our findings highlight model merging as a highly efficient and effective paradigm for L2S reasoning, offering a practical solution to the overthinking problem while maintaining the robustness of System 2 reasoning.

Title: UniHDSA: A Unified Relation Prediction Approach for Hierarchical
  Document Structure Analysis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15893
Summary: Document structure analysis, aka document layout analysis, is crucial for understanding both the physical layout and logical structure of documents, serving information retrieval, document summarization, knowledge extraction, etc. Hierarchical Document Structure Analysis (HDSA) specifically aims to restore the hierarchical structure of documents created using authoring software with hierarchical schemas. Previous research has primarily followed two approaches: one focuses on tackling specific subtasks of HDSA in isolation, such as table detection or reading order prediction, while the other adopts a unified framework that uses multiple branches or modules, each designed to address a distinct task. In this work, we propose a unified relation prediction approach for HDSA, called UniHDSA, which treats various HDSA sub-tasks as relation prediction problems and consolidates relation prediction labels into a unified label space. This allows a single relation prediction module to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, whether at a page-level or document-level structure analysis. To validate the effectiveness of UniHDSA, we develop a multimodal end-to-end system based on Transformer architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a hierarchical document structure analysis benchmark, Comp-HRDoc, and competitive results on a large-scale document layout analysis dataset, DocLayNet, effectively illustrating the superiority of our method across all sub-tasks. The Comp-HRDoc benchmark and UniHDSA's configurations are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/CompHRDoc.

Title: PathoHR: Breast Cancer Survival Prediction on High-Resolution
  Pathological Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17970
Summary: Breast cancer survival prediction in computational pathology presents a remarkable challenge due to tumor heterogeneity. For instance, different regions of the same tumor in the pathology image can show distinct morphological and molecular characteristics. This makes it difficult to extract representative features from whole slide images (WSIs) that truly reflect the tumor's aggressive potential and likely survival outcomes. In this paper, we present PathoHR, a novel pipeline for accurate breast cancer survival prediction that enhances any size of pathological images to enable more effective feature learning. Our approach entails (1) the incorporation of a plug-and-play high-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) to enhance patch-wise WSI representation, enabling more detailed and comprehensive feature extraction, (2) the systematic evaluation of multiple advanced similarity metrics for comparing WSI-extracted features, optimizing the representation learning process to better capture tumor characteristics, (3) the demonstration that smaller image patches enhanced follow the proposed pipeline can achieve equivalent or superior prediction accuracy compared to raw larger patches, while significantly reducing computational overhead. Experimental findings valid that PathoHR provides the potential way of integrating enhanced image resolution with optimized feature learning to advance computational pathology, offering a promising direction for more accurate and efficient breast cancer survival prediction. Code will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/PathoHR.

Title: Image as an IMU: Estimating Camera Motion from a Single Motion-Blurred
  Image
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17358
Summary: In many robotics and VR/AR applications, fast camera motions cause a high level of motion blur, causing existing camera pose estimation methods to fail. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages motion blur as a rich cue for motion estimation rather than treating it as an unwanted artifact. Our approach works by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image. We then recover the instantaneous camera velocity by solving a linear least squares problem under the small motion assumption. In essence, our method produces an IMU-like measurement that robustly captures fast and aggressive camera movements. To train our model, we construct a large-scale dataset with realistic synthetic motion blur derived from ScanNet++v2 and further refine our model by training end-to-end on real data using our fully differentiable pipeline. Extensive evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art angular and translational velocity estimates, outperforming current methods like MASt3R and COLMAP.

Title: ViLBench: A Suite for Vision-Language Process Reward Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20271
Summary: Process-supervised reward models serve as a fine-grained function that provides detailed step-wise feedback to model responses, facilitating effective selection of reasoning trajectories for complex tasks. Despite its advantages, evaluation on PRMs remains less explored, especially in the multimodal domain. To address this gap, this paper first benchmarks current vision large language models (VLLMs) as two types of reward models: output reward models (ORMs) and process reward models (PRMs) on multiple vision-language benchmarks, which reveal that neither ORM nor PRM consistently outperforms across all tasks, and superior VLLMs do not necessarily yield better rewarding performance. To further advance evaluation, we introduce ViLBench, a vision-language benchmark designed to require intensive process reward signals. Notably, OpenAI's GPT-4o with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) achieves only 27.3% accuracy, indicating the benchmark's challenge for current VLLMs. Lastly, we preliminarily showcase a promising pathway towards bridging the gap between general VLLMs and reward models -- by collecting 73.6K vision-language process reward data using an enhanced tree-search algorithm, our 3B model is able to achieve an average improvement of 3.3% over standard CoT and up to 2.5% compared to its untrained counterpart on ViLBench by selecting OpenAI o1's generations. We release the implementations at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/ViLBench with our code, model, and data.

Title: Qwen2.5-Omni Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20215
Summary: In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs, both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two modalities, we propose Thinker-Talker architecture. In this framework, Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench. Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in robustness and naturalness.

Title: LEGO-Puzzles: How Good Are MLLMs at Multi-Step Spatial Reasoning?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19990
Summary: Multi-step spatial reasoning entails understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships across multiple sequential steps, which is crucial for tackling complex real-world applications, such as robotic manipulation, autonomous navigation, and automated assembly. To assess how well current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have acquired this fundamental capability, we introduce LEGO-Puzzles, a scalable benchmark designed to evaluate both spatial understanding and sequential reasoning in MLLMs through LEGO-based tasks. LEGO-Puzzles consists of 1,100 carefully curated visual question-answering (VQA) samples spanning 11 distinct tasks, ranging from basic spatial understanding to complex multi-step reasoning. Based on LEGO-Puzzles, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and uncover significant limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities: even the most powerful MLLMs can answer only about half of the test cases, whereas human participants achieve over 90\% accuracy. In addition to VQA tasks, we evaluate MLLMs' abilities to generate LEGO images following assembly illustrations. Our experiments show that only Gemini-2.0-Flash and GPT-4o exhibit a limited ability to follow these instructions, while other MLLMs either replicate the input image or generate completely irrelevant outputs. Overall, LEGO-Puzzles exposes critical deficiencies in existing MLLMs' spatial understanding and sequential reasoning capabilities, and underscores the need for further advancements in multimodal spatial reasoning.

Title: LogQuant: Log-Distributed 2-Bit Quantization of KV Cache with Superior
  Accuracy Preservation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19950
Summary: We introduce LogQuant, a groundbreaking 2-bit quantization technique for KV Cache in large language model (LLM) inference, delivering substantial memory savings while preserving superior performance. Previous methods either assume that later tokens are more important or attempt to predict important tokens based on earlier attention patterns. Both approaches, however, can result in performance bottlenecks or frequent mispredictions.   LogQuant takes a different approach. By applying a log-based filtering mechanism, it selectively compresses the KV Cache across the entire context, achieving better performance with the same or even reduced memory footprint compared to existing methods. In benchmark tests, it enhances throughput by 25% and boosts batch size by 60% without increasing memory consumption. For challenging tasks such as Math and Code Completion, LogQuant improves accuracy by 40% to 200% at the same compression ratio, outperforming comparable techniques.LogQuant integrates effortlessly with popular inference frameworks like Python's transformers library. Implementation can be available in https://github.com/Concyclics/LogQuantKV.

Title: Sparse Logit Sampling: Accelerating Knowledge Distillation in LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16870
Summary: Knowledge distillation can be a cost-effective technique to distill knowledge in Large Language Models, if the teacher output logits can be pre-computed and cached. However, successfully applying this to pre-training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we prove that naive approaches for sparse knowledge distillation such as caching Top-K probabilities, while intuitive, provide biased estimates of teacher probability distribution to the student, resulting in suboptimal performance and calibration. We propose an importance-sampling-based method `Random Sampling Knowledge Distillation', which provides unbiased estimates, preserves the gradient in expectation, and requires storing significantly sparser logits. Our method enables faster training of student models with marginal overhead (<10%) compared to cross-entropy based training, while maintaining competitive performance compared to full distillation, across a range of model sizes from 300M to 3B.

Title: Attention IoU: Examining Biases in CelebA using Attention Maps
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19846
Summary: Computer vision models have been shown to exhibit and amplify biases across a wide array of datasets and tasks. Existing methods for quantifying bias in classification models primarily focus on dataset distribution and model performance on subgroups, overlooking the internal workings of a model. We introduce the Attention-IoU (Attention Intersection over Union) metric and related scores, which use attention maps to reveal biases within a model's internal representations and identify image features potentially causing the biases. First, we validate Attention-IoU on the synthetic Waterbirds dataset, showing that the metric accurately measures model bias. We then analyze the CelebA dataset, finding that Attention-IoU uncovers correlations beyond accuracy disparities. Through an investigation of individual attributes through the protected attribute of Male, we examine the distinct ways biases are represented in CelebA. Lastly, by subsampling the training set to change attribute correlations, we demonstrate that Attention-IoU reveals potential confounding variables not present in dataset labels.

Title: MCTS-RAG: Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Monte Carlo Tree
  Search
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20757
Summary: We introduce MCTS-RAG, a novel approach that enhances the reasoning capabilities of small language models on knowledge-intensive tasks by leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide relevant context and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine reasoning paths. MCTS-RAG dynamically integrates retrieval and reasoning through an iterative decision-making process. Unlike standard RAG methods, which typically retrieve information independently from reasoning and thus integrate knowledge suboptimally, or conventional MCTS reasoning, which depends solely on internal model knowledge without external facts, MCTS-RAG combines structured reasoning with adaptive retrieval. This integrated approach enhances decision-making, reduces hallucinations, and ensures improved factual accuracy and response consistency. The experimental results on multiple reasoning and knowledge-intensive datasets datasets (i.e., ComplexWebQA, GPQA, and FoolMeTwice) show that our method enables small-scale LMs to achieve performance comparable to frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by effectively scaling inference-time compute, setting a new standard for reasoning in small-scale models.

Title: Dita: Scaling Diffusion Transformer for Generalist
  Vision-Language-Action Policy
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19757
Summary: While recent vision-language-action models trained on diverse robot datasets exhibit promising generalization capabilities with limited in-domain data, their reliance on compact action heads to predict discretized or continuous actions constrains adaptability to heterogeneous action spaces. We present Dita, a scalable framework that leverages Transformer architectures to directly denoise continuous action sequences through a unified multimodal diffusion process. Departing from prior methods that condition denoising on fused embeddings via shallow networks, Dita employs in-context conditioning -- enabling fine-grained alignment between denoised actions and raw visual tokens from historical observations. This design explicitly models action deltas and environmental nuances. By scaling the diffusion action denoiser alongside the Transformer's scalability, Dita effectively integrates cross-embodiment datasets across diverse camera perspectives, observation scenes, tasks, and action spaces. Such synergy enhances robustness against various variances and facilitates the successful execution of long-horizon tasks. Evaluations across extensive benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art or comparative performance in simulation. Notably, Dita achieves robust real-world adaptation to environmental variances and complex long-horizon tasks through 10-shot finetuning, using only third-person camera inputs. The architecture establishes a versatile, lightweight and open-source baseline for generalist robot policy learning. Project Page: https://robodita.github.io.

Title: GenHancer: Imperfect Generative Models are Secretly Strong
  Vision-Centric Enhancers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19480
Summary: The synergy between generative and discriminative models receives growing attention. While discriminative Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) excels in high-level semantics, it struggles with perceiving fine-grained visual details. Generally, to enhance representations, generative models take CLIP's visual features as conditions for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. In this work, we empirically found that visually perfect generations are not always optimal for representation enhancement. The essence lies in effectively extracting fine-grained knowledge from generative models while mitigating irrelevant information. To explore critical factors, we delve into three aspects: (1) Conditioning mechanisms: We found that even a small number of local tokens can drastically reduce the difficulty of reconstruction, leading to collapsed training. We thus conclude that utilizing only global visual tokens as conditions is the most effective strategy. (2) Denoising configurations: We observed that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. To address this, we propose a two-stage training strategy to prioritize learning useful visual knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate that lightweight denoisers can yield remarkable improvements. (3) Generation paradigms: We explore both continuous and discrete denoisers with desirable outcomes, validating the versatility of our method. Through our in-depth explorations, we have finally arrived at an effective method, namely GenHancer, which consistently outperforms prior arts on the MMVP-VLM benchmark, e.g., 6.0% on OpenAICLIP. The enhanced CLIP can be further plugged into multimodal large language models for better vision-centric performance. All the models and codes are made publicly available.

Title: Beyond Words: Advancing Long-Text Image Generation via Multimodal
  Autoregressive Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20198
Summary: Recent advancements in autoregressive and diffusion models have led to strong performance in image generation with short scene text words. However, generating coherent, long-form text in images, such as paragraphs in slides or documents, remains a major challenge for current generative models. We present the first work specifically focused on long text image generation, addressing a critical gap in existing text-to-image systems that typically handle only brief phrases or single sentences. Through comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art autoregressive generation models, we identify the image tokenizer as a critical bottleneck in text generating quality. To address this, we introduce a novel text-focused, binary tokenizer optimized for capturing detailed scene text features. Leveraging our tokenizer, we develop \ModelName, a multimodal autoregressive model that excels in generating high-quality long-text images with unprecedented fidelity. Our model offers robust controllability, enabling customization of text properties such as font style, size, color, and alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ModelName~significantly outperforms SD3.5 Large~sd3 and GPT4o~gpt4o with DALL-E 3~dalle3 in generating long text accurately, consistently, and flexibly. Beyond its technical achievements, \ModelName~opens up exciting opportunities for innovative applications like interleaved document and PowerPoint generation, establishing a new frontier in long-text image generating.

Title: BizGen: Advancing Article-level Visual Text Rendering for Infographics
  Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20672
Summary: Recently, state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models, such as Flux and Ideogram 2.0, have made significant progress in sentence-level visual text rendering. In this paper, we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content, including infographics and slides, based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts. The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data.   In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts, ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable, high-quality business content dataset, i.e., Infographics-650K, equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme, which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts, and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG.   We demonstrate the strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally, we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component. We hope our constructed Infographics-650K and BizEval can encourage the broader community to advance the progress of business content generation.

Built upon the mainstream diffusion transformer paradigm, Wan achieves significant advancements in generative capabilities through a series of innovations, including our novel VAE, scalable pre-training strategies, large-scale data curation, and automated evaluation metrics. These contributions collectively enhance the model's performance and versatility. Specifically, Wan is characterized by four key features: Leading Performance: The 14B model of Wan, trained on a vast dataset comprising billions of images and videos, demonstrates the scaling laws of video generation with respect to both data and model size.

Title: Self-Supervised Learning of Motion Concepts by Optimizing
  Counterfactuals
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19953
Summary: Estimating motion in videos is an essential computer vision problem with many downstream applications, including controllable video generation and robotics. Current solutions are primarily trained using synthetic data or require tuning of situation-specific heuristics, which inherently limits these models' capabilities in real-world contexts. Despite recent developments in large-scale self-supervised learning from videos, leveraging such representations for motion estimation remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we develop Opt-CWM, a self-supervised technique for flow and occlusion estimation from a pre-trained next-frame prediction model. Opt-CWM works by learning to optimize counterfactual probes that extract motion information from a base video model, avoiding the need for fixed heuristics while training on unrestricted video inputs. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for motion estimation on real-world videos while requiring no labeled data.

Title: AccVideo: Accelerating Video Diffusion Model with Synthetic Dataset
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19462
Summary: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of video generation. However, their iterative denoising nature requires a large number of inference steps to generate a video, which is slow and computationally expensive. In this paper, we begin with a detailed analysis of the challenges present in existing diffusion distillation methods and propose a novel efficient method, namely AccVideo, to reduce the inference steps for accelerating video diffusion models with synthetic dataset. We leverage the pretrained video diffusion model to generate multiple valid denoising trajectories as our synthetic dataset, which eliminates the use of useless data points during distillation. Based on the synthetic dataset, we design a trajectory-based few-step guidance that utilizes key data points from the denoising trajectories to learn the noise-to-video mapping, enabling video generation in fewer steps. Furthermore, since the synthetic dataset captures the data distribution at each diffusion timestep, we introduce an adversarial training strategy to align the output distribution of the student model with that of our synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing the video quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves 8.5x improvements in generation speed compared to the teacher model while maintaining comparable performance. Compared to previous accelerating methods, our approach is capable of generating videos with higher quality and resolution, i.e., 5-seconds, 720x1280, 24fps.

Title: Gemini Robotics: Bringing AI into the Physical World
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20020
Summary: Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world.

PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20756
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

Title: Open Deep Search: Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20201
Summary: We introduce Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the increasing gap between the proprietary search AI solutions, such as Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning Pro and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview, and their open-source counterparts. The main innovation introduced in ODS is to augment the reasoning capabilities of the latest open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can judiciously use web search tools to answer queries. Concretely, ODS consists of two components that work with a base LLM chosen by the user: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Reasoning Agent interprets the given task and completes it by orchestrating a sequence of actions that includes calling tools, one of which is the Open Search Tool. Open Search Tool is a novel web search tool that outperforms proprietary counterparts. Together with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses the existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. For example, on the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves the best existing baseline of the recently released GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy. ODS is a general framework for seamlessly augmenting any LLMs -- for example, DeepSeek-R1 that achieves 82.4% on SimpleQA and 30.1% on FRAMES -- with search and reasoning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance: 88.3% on SimpleQA and 75.3% on FRAMES.

Title: DINeMo: Learning Neural Mesh Models with no 3D Annotations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20220
Summary: Category-level 3D/6D pose estimation is a crucial step towards comprehensive 3D scene understanding, which would enable a broad range of applications in robotics and embodied AI. Recent works explored neural mesh models that approach a range of 2D and 3D tasks from an analysis-by-synthesis perspective. Despite the largely enhanced robustness to partial occlusion and domain shifts, these methods depended heavily on 3D annotations for part-contrastive learning, which confines them to a narrow set of categories and hinders efficient scaling. In this work, we present DINeMo, a novel neural mesh model that is trained with no 3D annotations by leveraging pseudo-correspondence obtained from large visual foundation models. We adopt a bidirectional pseudo-correspondence generation method, which produce pseudo correspondence utilize both local appearance features and global context information. Experimental results on car datasets demonstrate that our DINeMo outperforms previous zero- and few-shot 3D pose estimation by a wide margin, narrowing the gap with fully-supervised methods by 67.3%. Our DINeMo also scales effectively and efficiently when incorporating more unlabeled images during training, which demonstrate the advantages over supervised learning methods that rely on 3D annotations.

Title: Unconditional Priors Matter! Improving Conditional Generation of
  Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20240
Summary: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a fundamental technique in training conditional diffusion models. The common practice for CFG-based training is to use a single network to learn both conditional and unconditional noise prediction, with a small dropout rate for conditioning. However, we observe that the joint learning of unconditional noise with limited bandwidth in training results in poor priors for the unconditional case. More importantly, these poor unconditional noise predictions become a serious reason for degrading the quality of conditional generation. Inspired by the fact that most CFG-based conditional models are trained by fine-tuning a base model with better unconditional generation, we first show that simply replacing the unconditional noise in CFG with that predicted by the base model can significantly improve conditional generation. Furthermore, we show that a diffusion model other than the one the fine-tuned model was trained on can be used for unconditional noise replacement. We experimentally verify our claim with a range of CFG-based conditional models for both image and video generation, including Zero-1-to-3, Versatile Diffusion, DiT, DynamiCrafter, and InstructPix2Pix.

Title: Mask^2DiT: Dual Mask-based Diffusion Transformer for Multi-Scene Long
  Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19881
Summary: Sora has unveiled the immense potential of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture in single-scene video generation. However, the more challenging task of multi-scene video generation, which offers broader applications, remains relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Mask^2DiT, a novel approach that establishes fine-grained, one-to-one alignment between video segments and their corresponding text annotations. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric binary mask at each attention layer within the DiT architecture, ensuring that each text annotation applies exclusively to its respective video segment while preserving temporal coherence across visual tokens. This attention mechanism enables precise segment-level textual-to-visual alignment, allowing the DiT architecture to effectively handle video generation tasks with a fixed number of scenes. To further equip the DiT architecture with the ability to generate additional scenes based on existing ones, we incorporate a segment-level conditional mask, which conditions each newly generated segment on the preceding video segments, thereby enabling auto-regressive scene extension. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments confirm that Mask^2DiT excels in maintaining visual consistency across segments while ensuring semantic alignment between each segment and its corresponding text description.

Title: Efficient Model Development through Fine-tuning Transfer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.20110
Summary: Modern LLMs struggle with efficient updates, as each new pretrained model version requires repeating expensive alignment processes. This challenge also applies to domain- or language-specific models, where fine-tuning on specialized data must be redone for every new base model release. In this paper, we explore the transfer of fine-tuning updates between model versions. Specifically, we derive the diff vector from one source model version, which represents the weight changes from fine-tuning, and apply it to the base model of a different target version. Through empirical evaluations on various open-weight model versions, we show that transferring diff vectors can significantly improve the target base model, often achieving performance comparable to its fine-tuned counterpart. For example, reusing the fine-tuning updates from Llama 3.0 8B leads to an absolute accuracy improvement of 10.7% on GPQA over the base Llama 3.1 8B without additional training, surpassing Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. In a multilingual model development setting, we show that this approach can significantly increase performance on target-language tasks without retraining, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.7% and 15.5% on Global MMLU for Malagasy and Turkish, respectively, compared to Llama 3.1 8B Instruct. Our controlled experiments reveal that fine-tuning transfer is most effective when the source and target models are linearly connected in the parameter space. Additionally, we demonstrate that fine-tuning transfer offers a stronger and more computationally efficient starting point for further fine-tuning. Finally, we propose an iterative recycling-then-finetuning approach for continuous model development, which improves both efficiency and effectiveness. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning transfer is a viable strategy to reduce training costs while maintaining model performance.

Title: Any6D: Model-free 6D Pose Estimation of Novel Objects
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18673
Summary: We introduce Any6D, a model-free framework for 6D object pose estimation that requires only a single RGB-D anchor image to estimate both the 6D pose and size of unknown objects in novel scenes. Unlike existing methods that rely on textured 3D models or multiple viewpoints, Any6D leverages a joint object alignment process to enhance 2D-3D alignment and metric scale estimation for improved pose accuracy. Our approach integrates a render-and-compare strategy to generate and refine pose hypotheses, enabling robust performance in scenarios with occlusions, non-overlapping views, diverse lighting conditions, and large cross-environment variations. We evaluate our method on five challenging datasets: REAL275, Toyota-Light, HO3D, YCBINEOAT, and LM-O, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods for novel object pose estimation.

Title: FirePlace: Geometric Refinements of LLM Common Sense Reasoning for 3D
  Object Placement
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04919
Summary: Scene generation with 3D assets presents a complex challenge, requiring both high-level semantic understanding and low-level geometric reasoning. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at semantic tasks, their application to 3D scene generation is hindered by their limited grounding on 3D geometry. In this paper, we investigate how to best work with MLLMs in an object placement task. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel framework, FirePlace, that applies existing MLLMs in (1) 3D geometric reasoning and the extraction of relevant geometric details from the 3D scene, (2) constructing and solving geometric constraints on the extracted low-level geometry, and (3) pruning for final placements that conform to common sense. By combining geometric reasoning with real-world understanding of MLLMs, our method can propose object placements that satisfy both geometric constraints as well as high-level semantic common-sense considerations. Our experiments show that these capabilities allow our method to place objects more effectively in complex scenes with intricate geometry, surpassing the quality of prior work.

Title: LLaVAction: evaluating and training multi-modal large language models
  for action recognition
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18712
Summary: Understanding human behavior requires measuring behavioral actions. Due to its complexity, behavior is best mapped onto a rich, semantic structure such as language. The recent development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) is a promising candidate for a wide range of action understanding tasks. In this work, we focus on evaluating and then improving MLLMs to perform action recognition. We reformulate EPIC-KITCHENS-100, one of the largest and most challenging egocentric action datasets, to the form of video multiple question answering (EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA). We show that when we sample difficult incorrect answers as distractors, leading MLLMs struggle to recognize the correct actions. We propose a series of methods that greatly improve the MLLMs' ability to perform action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art on both the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 validation set, as well as outperforming GPT-4o by 21 points in accuracy on EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA. Lastly, we show improvements on other action-related video benchmarks such as EgoSchema, PerceptionTest, LongVideoBench, VideoMME and MVBench, suggesting that MLLMs are a promising path forward for complex action tasks.

Title: DiffPortrait360: Consistent Portrait Diffusion for 360 View Synthesis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15667
Summary: Generating high-quality 360-degree views of human heads from single-view images is essential for enabling accessible immersive telepresence applications and scalable personalized content creation. While cutting-edge methods for full head generation are limited to modeling realistic human heads, the latest diffusion-based approaches for style-omniscient head synthesis can produce only frontal views and struggle with view consistency, preventing their conversion into true 3D models for rendering from arbitrary angles. We introduce a novel approach that generates fully consistent 360-degree head views, accommodating human, stylized, and anthropomorphic forms, including accessories like glasses and hats. Our method builds on the DiffPortrait3D framework, incorporating a custom ControlNet for back-of-head detail generation and a dual appearance module to ensure global front-back consistency. By training on continuous view sequences and integrating a back reference image, our approach achieves robust, locally continuous view synthesis. Our model can be used to produce high-quality neural radiance fields (NeRFs) for real-time, free-viewpoint rendering, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in object synthesis and 360-degree head generation for very challenging input portraits.

Title: OpenCity3D: What do Vision-Language Models know about Urban
  Environments?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16776
Summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) show great promise for 3D scene understanding but are mainly applied to indoor spaces or autonomous driving, focusing on low-level tasks like segmentation. This work expands their use to urban-scale environments by leveraging 3D reconstructions from multi-view aerial imagery. We propose OpenCity3D, an approach that addresses high-level tasks, such as population density estimation, building age classification, property price prediction, crime rate assessment, and noise pollution evaluation. Our findings highlight OpenCity3D's impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities, showcasing adaptability to new contexts. This research establishes a new paradigm for language-driven urban analytics, enabling applications in planning, policy, and environmental monitoring. See our project page: opencity3d.github.io

Title: ST-VLM: Kinematic Instruction Tuning for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in
  Vision-Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19355
Summary: Spatio-temporal reasoning is essential in understanding real-world environments in various fields, eg, autonomous driving and sports analytics. Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.

Title: Co-SemDepth: Fast Joint Semantic Segmentation and Depth Estimation on
  Aerial Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17982
Summary: Understanding the geometric and semantic properties of the scene is crucial in autonomous navigation and particularly challenging in the case of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. Such information may be by obtained by estimating depth and semantic segmentation maps of the surrounding environment and for their practical use in autonomous navigation, the procedure must be performed as close to real-time as possible. In this paper, we leverage monocular cameras on aerial robots to predict depth and semantic maps in low-altitude unstructured environments. We propose a joint deep-learning architecture that can perform the two tasks accurately and rapidly, and validate its effectiveness on MidAir and Aeroscapes benchmark datasets. Our joint-architecture proves to be competitive or superior to the other single and joint architecture methods while performing its task fast predicting 20.2 FPS on a single NVIDIA quadro p5000 GPU and it has a low memory footprint.

Title: PhysTwin: Physics-Informed Reconstruction and Simulation of Deformable
  Objects from Videos
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17973
Summary: Creating a physical digital twin of a real-world object has immense potential in robotics, content creation, and XR. In this paper, we present PhysTwin, a novel framework that uses sparse videos of dynamic objects under interaction to produce a photo- and physically realistic, real-time interactive virtual replica. Our approach centers on two key components: (1) a physics-informed representation that combines spring-mass models for realistic physical simulation, generative shape models for geometry, and Gaussian splats for rendering; and (2) a novel multi-stage, optimization-based inverse modeling framework that reconstructs complete geometry, infers dense physical properties, and replicates realistic appearance from videos. Our method integrates an inverse physics framework with visual perception cues, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction even from partial, occluded, and limited viewpoints. PhysTwin supports modeling various deformable objects, including ropes, stuffed animals, cloth, and delivery packages. Experiments show that PhysTwin outperforms competing methods in reconstruction, rendering, future prediction, and simulation under novel interactions. We further demonstrate its applications in interactive real-time simulation and model-based robotic motion planning.

Title: FullDiT: Multi-Task Video Generative Foundation Model with Full
  Attention
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19907
Summary: Current video generative foundation models primarily focus on text-to-video tasks, providing limited control for fine-grained video content creation. Although adapter-based approaches (e.g., ControlNet) enable additional controls with minimal fine-tuning, they encounter challenges when integrating multiple conditions, including: branch conflicts between independently trained adapters, parameter redundancy leading to increased computational cost, and suboptimal performance compared to full fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce FullDiT, a unified foundation model for video generation that seamlessly integrates multiple conditions via unified full-attention mechanisms. By fusing multi-task conditions into a unified sequence representation and leveraging the long-context learning ability of full self-attention to capture condition dynamics, FullDiT reduces parameter overhead, avoids conditions conflict, and shows scalability and emergent ability. We further introduce FullBench for multi-task video generation evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that FullDiT achieves state-of-the-art results, highlighting the efficacy of full-attention in complex multi-task video generation.

Title: xKV: Cross-Layer SVD for KV-Cache Compression
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18893
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context windows enable powerful applications but come at the cost of high memory consumption to store the Key and Value states (KV-Cache). Recent studies attempted to merge KV-cache from multiple layers into shared representations, yet these approaches either require expensive pretraining or rely on assumptions of high per-token cosine similarity across layers which generally does not hold in practice. We find that the dominant singular vectors are remarkably well-aligned across multiple layers of the KV-Cache. Exploiting this insight, we propose xKV, a simple post-training method that applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the KV-Cache of grouped layers. xKV consolidates the KV-Cache of multiple layers into a shared low-rank subspace, significantly reducing KV-Cache sizes. Through extensive evaluations on the RULER long-context benchmark with widely-used LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.1 and Qwen2.5), xKV achieves up to 6.8x higher compression rates than state-of-the-art inter-layer technique while improving accuracy by 2.7%. Moreover, xKV is compatible with the emerging Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-V2), yielding a notable 3x compression rates on coding tasks without performance degradation. These results highlight xKV's strong capability and versatility in addressing memory bottlenecks for long-context LLM inference. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/xKV.

Title: Can Vision-Language Models Answer Face to Face Questions in the
  Real-World?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19356
Summary: AI models have made significant strides in recent years in their ability to describe and answer questions about real-world images. They have also made progress in the ability to converse with users in real-time using audio input. This raises the question: have we reached the point where AI models, connected to a camera and microphone, can converse with users in real-time about scenes and events that are unfolding live in front of the camera? This has been a long-standing goal in AI and is a prerequisite for real-world AI assistants and humanoid robots to interact with humans in everyday situations. In this work, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark, the Qualcomm Interactive Video Dataset (IVD), which allows us to assess the extent to which existing models can support these abilities, and to what degree these capabilities can be instilled through fine-tuning. The dataset is based on a simple question-answering setup, where users ask questions that the system has to answer, in real-time, based on the camera and audio input. We show that existing models fall far behind human performance on this task, and we identify the main sources for the performance gap. However, we also show that for many of the required perceptual skills, fine-tuning on this form of data can significantly reduce this gap.

Title: WikiAutoGen: Towards Multi-Modal Wikipedia-Style Article Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19065
Summary: Knowledge discovery and collection are intelligence-intensive tasks that traditionally require significant human effort to ensure high-quality outputs. Recent research has explored multi-agent frameworks for automating Wikipedia-style article generation by retrieving and synthesizing information from the internet. However, these methods primarily focus on text-only generation, overlooking the importance of multimodal content in enhancing informativeness and engagement. In this work, we introduce WikiAutoGen, a novel system for automated multimodal Wikipedia-style article generation. Unlike prior approaches, WikiAutoGen retrieves and integrates relevant images alongside text, enriching both the depth and visual appeal of generated content. To further improve factual accuracy and comprehensiveness, we propose a multi-perspective self-reflection mechanism, which critically assesses retrieved content from diverse viewpoints to enhance reliability, breadth, and coherence, etc. Additionally, we introduce WikiSeek, a benchmark comprising Wikipedia articles with topics paired with both textual and image-based representations, designed to evaluate multimodal knowledge generation on more challenging topics. Experimental results show that WikiAutoGen outperforms previous methods by 8%-29% on our WikiSeek benchmark, producing more accurate, coherent, and visually enriched Wikipedia-style articles. We show some of our generated examples in https://wikiautogen.github.io/ .

Title: Overcoming Vocabulary Mismatch: Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided
  Language Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19123
Summary: Using large teacher models to guide the training of smaller student models has become the prevailing paradigm for efficient and effective learning. However, vocabulary mismatches between teacher and student language models pose significant challenges in language modeling, resulting in divergent token sequences and output distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling (VocAgnoLM), a novel approach that bridges the gap caused by vocabulary mismatch through two key methods: (1) Token-level Lexical Alignment, which aligns token sequences across mismatched vocabularies, and (2) Teacher Guided Loss, which leverages the loss of teacher model to guide effective student training. We demonstrate its effectiveness in language modeling with 1B student model using various 7B teacher models with different vocabularies. Notably, with Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, a teacher model sharing only about 6% of its vocabulary with TinyLlama, VocAgnoLM achieves a 46% performance improvement compared to naive continual pretraining. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VocAgnoLM consistently benefits from stronger teacher models, providing a robust solution to vocabulary mismatches in language modeling.

Title: FRESA:Feedforward Reconstruction of Personalized Skinned Avatars from
  Few Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19207
Summary: We present a novel method for reconstructing personalized 3D human avatars with realistic animation from only a few images. Due to the large variations in body shapes, poses, and cloth types, existing methods mostly require hours of per-subject optimization during inference, which limits their practical applications. In contrast, we learn a universal prior from over a thousand clothed humans to achieve instant feedforward generation and zero-shot generalization. Specifically, instead of rigging the avatar with shared skinning weights, we jointly infer personalized avatar shape, skinning weights, and pose-dependent deformations, which effectively improves overall geometric fidelity and reduces deformation artifacts. Moreover, to normalize pose variations and resolve coupled ambiguity between canonical shapes and skinning weights, we design a 3D canonicalization process to produce pixel-aligned initial conditions, which helps to reconstruct fine-grained geometric details. We then propose a multi-frame feature aggregation to robustly reduce artifacts introduced in canonicalization and fuse a plausible avatar preserving person-specific identities. Finally, we train the model in an end-to-end framework on a large-scale capture dataset, which contains diverse human subjects paired with high-quality 3D scans. Extensive experiments show that our method generates more authentic reconstruction and animation than state-of-the-arts, and can be directly generalized to inputs from casually taken phone photos.

Title: LPOSS: Label Propagation Over Patches and Pixels for Open-vocabulary
  Semantic Segmentation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19777
Summary: We propose a training-free method for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation using Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs). Our approach enhances the initial per-patch predictions of VLMs through label propagation, which jointly optimizes predictions by incorporating patch-to-patch relationships. Since VLMs are primarily optimized for cross-modal alignment and not for intra-modal similarity, we use a Vision Model (VM) that is observed to better capture these relationships. We address resolution limitations inherent to patch-based encoders by applying label propagation at the pixel level as a refinement step, significantly improving segmentation accuracy near class boundaries. Our method, called LPOSS+, performs inference over the entire image, avoiding window-based processing and thereby capturing contextual interactions across the full image. LPOSS+ achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods, across a diverse set of datasets. Code: https://github.com/vladan-stojnic/LPOSS

Title: Towards a Unified Copernicus Foundation Model for Earth Vision
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11849
Summary: Advances in Earth observation (EO) foundation models have unlocked the potential of big satellite data to learn generic representations from space, benefiting a wide range of downstream applications crucial to our planet. However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

Title: Strong Baseline: Multi-UAV Tracking via YOLOv12 with BoT-SORT-ReID
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17237
Summary: Detecting and tracking multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in thermal infrared video is inherently challenging due to low contrast, environmental noise, and small target sizes. This paper provides a straightforward approach to address multi-UAV tracking in thermal infrared video, leveraging recent advances in detection and tracking. Instead of relying on the YOLOv5 with the DeepSORT pipeline, we present a tracking framework built on YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT, enhanced with tailored training and inference strategies. We evaluate our approach following the metrics from the 4th Anti-UAV Challenge and demonstrate competitive performance. Notably, we achieve strong results without using contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion to enrich UAV features, highlighting our approach as a "Strong Baseline" for the multi-UAV tracking task. We provide implementation details, in-depth experimental analysis, and a discussion of potential improvements. The code is available at https://github.com/wish44165/YOLOv12-BoT-SORT-ReID .

Title: Spot the Fake: Large Multimodal Model-Based Synthetic Image Detection
  with Artifact Explanation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14905
Summary: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection. Despite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and do not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed for both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only excels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural language explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability. Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for synthetic image detection. The dataset and code will be released in: https://github.com/opendatalab/FakeVLM.

Title: MDocAgent: A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document
  Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13964
Summary: Document Question Answering (DocQA) is a very common task. Existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) or Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often prioritize information from a single modal, failing to effectively integrate textual and visual cues. These approaches struggle with complex multi-modal reasoning, limiting their performance on real-world documents. We present MDocAgent (A Multi-Modal Multi-Agent Framework for Document Understanding), a novel RAG and multi-agent framework that leverages both text and image. Our system employs five specialized agents: a general agent, a critical agent, a text agent, an image agent and a summarizing agent. These agents engage in multi-modal context retrieval, combining their individual insights to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the document's content. This collaborative approach enables the system to synthesize information from both textual and visual components, leading to improved accuracy in question answering. Preliminary experiments on five benchmarks like MMLongBench, LongDocURL demonstrate the effectiveness of our MDocAgent, achieve an average improvement of 12.1% compared to current state-of-the-art method. This work contributes to the development of more robust and comprehensive DocQA systems capable of handling the complexities of real-world documents containing rich textual and visual information. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/aiming-lab/MDocAgent.

Title: Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19903
Summary: High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o, and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.

Title: Exploring Hallucination of Large Multimodal Models in Video
  Understanding: Benchmark, Analysis and Mitigation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19622
Summary: The hallucination of large multimodal models (LMMs), providing responses that appear correct but are actually incorrect, limits their reliability and applicability. This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%. The code and data are public at https://github.com/Hongcheng-Gao/HAVEN.
