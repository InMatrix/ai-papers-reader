Title: Self-Recognition in Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06946
Summary: A rapidly growing number of applications rely on a small set of closed-source language models (LMs). This dependency might introduce novel security risks if LMs develop self-recognition capabilities. Inspired by human identity verification methods, we propose a novel approach for assessing self-recognition in LMs using model-generated "security questions". Our test can be externally administered to keep track of frontier models as it does not require access to internal model parameters or output probabilities. We use our test to examine self-recognition in ten of the most capable open- and closed-source LMs currently publicly available. Our extensive experiments found no empirical evidence of general or consistent self-recognition in any examined LM. Instead, our results suggest that given a set of alternatives, LMs seek to pick the "best" answer, regardless of its origin. Moreover, we find indications that preferences about which models produce the best answers are consistent across LMs. We additionally uncover novel insights on position bias considerations for LMs in multiple-choice settings.

Title: Scaling Up Personalized Aesthetic Assessment via Task Vector Customization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07176
Summary: The task of personalized image aesthetic assessment seeks to tailor aesthetic score prediction models to match individual preferences with just a few user-provided inputs. However, the scalability and generalization capabilities of current approaches are considerably restricted by their reliance on an expensive curated database. To overcome this long-standing scalability challenge, we present a unique approach that leverages readily available databases for general image aesthetic assessment and image quality assessment. Specifically, we view each database as a distinct image score regression task that exhibits varying degrees of personalization potential. By determining optimal combinations of task vectors, known to represent specific traits of each database, we successfully create personalized models for individuals. This approach of integrating multiple models allows us to harness a substantial amount of data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generalizing to previously unseen domains-a challenge previous approaches have struggled to achieve-making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios. Our novel approach significantly advances the field by offering scalable solutions for personalized aesthetic assessment and establishing high standards for future research. https://yeolj00.github.io/personal-projects/personalized-aesthetics/

Title: Multimodal Self-Instruct: Synthetic Abstract Image and Visual Reasoning Instruction Using Language Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07053
Summary: Although most current large multimodal models (LMMs) can already understand photos of natural scenes and portraits, their understanding of abstract images, e.g., charts, maps, or layouts, and visual reasoning capabilities remains quite rudimentary. They often struggle with simple daily tasks, such as reading time from a clock, understanding a flowchart, or planning a route using a road map. In light of this, we design a multi-modal self-instruct, utilizing large language models and their code capabilities to synthesize massive abstract images and visual reasoning instructions across daily scenarios. Our strategy effortlessly creates a multimodal benchmark with 11,193 instructions for eight visual scenarios: charts, tables, simulated maps, dashboards, flowcharts, relation graphs, floor plans, and visual puzzles. This benchmark, constructed with simple lines and geometric elements, exposes the shortcomings of most advanced LMMs like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o in abstract image understanding, spatial relations reasoning, and visual element induction. Besides, to verify the quality of our synthetic data, we fine-tune an LMM using 62,476 synthetic chart, table and road map instructions. The results demonstrate improved chart understanding and map navigation performance, and also demonstrate potential benefits for other visual reasoning tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zwq2018/Multi-modal-Self-instruct.

Title: Is Your Model Really A Good Math Reasoner? Evaluating Mathematical Reasoning with Checklist
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08733
Summary: Exceptional mathematical reasoning ability is one of the key features that demonstrate the power of large language models (LLMs). How to comprehensively define and evaluate the mathematical abilities of LLMs, and even reflect the user experience in real-world scenarios, has emerged as a critical issue. Current benchmarks predominantly concentrate on problem-solving capabilities, which presents a substantial risk of model overfitting and fails to accurately represent genuine mathematical reasoning abilities. In this paper, we argue that if a model really understands a problem, it should be robustly and readily applied across a diverse array of tasks. Motivated by this, we introduce MATHCHECK, a well-designed checklist for testing task generalization and reasoning robustness, as well as an automatic tool to generate checklists efficiently. MATHCHECK includes multiple mathematical reasoning tasks and robustness test types to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of both mathematical reasoning ability and behavior testing. Utilizing MATHCHECK, we develop MATHCHECK-GSM and MATHCHECK-GEO to assess mathematical textual reasoning and multi-modal reasoning capabilities, respectively, serving as upgraded versions of benchmarks including GSM8k, GeoQA, UniGeo, and Geometry3K. We adopt MATHCHECK-GSM and MATHCHECK-GEO to evaluate over 20 LLMs and 11 MLLMs, assessing their comprehensive mathematical reasoning abilities. Our results demonstrate that while frontier LLMs like GPT-4o continue to excel in various abilities on the checklist, many other model families exhibit a significant decline. Further experiments indicate that, compared to traditional math benchmarks, MATHCHECK better reflects true mathematical abilities and represents mathematical intelligence more linearly, thereby supporting our design. On our MATHCHECK, we can easily conduct detailed behavior analysis to deeply investigate models.

Title: Towards Building Specialized Generalist AI with System 1 and System 2 Fusion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08642
Summary: In this perspective paper, we introduce the concept of Specialized Generalist Artificial Intelligence (SGAI or simply SGI) as a crucial milestone toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to directly scaling general abilities, SGI is defined as AI that specializes in at least one task, surpassing human experts, while also retaining general abilities. This fusion path enables SGI to rapidly achieve high-value areas. We categorize SGI into three stages based on the level of mastery over professional skills and generality performance. Additionally, we discuss the necessity of SGI in addressing issues associated with large language models, such as their insufficient generality, specialized capabilities, uncertainty in innovation, and practical applications. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual framework for developing SGI that integrates the strengths of Systems 1 and 2 cognitive processing. This framework comprises three layers and four key components, which focus on enhancing individual abilities and facilitating collaborative evolution. We conclude by summarizing the potential challenges and suggesting future directions. We hope that the proposed SGI will provide insights into further research and applications towards achieving AGI.

Title: Map It Anywhere (MIA): Empowering Bird's Eye View Mapping using Large-scale Public Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08726
Summary: Top-down Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a popular representation for ground robot navigation due to their richness and flexibility for downstream tasks. While recent methods have shown promise for predicting BEV maps from First-Person View (FPV) images, their generalizability is limited to small regions captured by current autonomous vehicle-based datasets. In this context, we show that a more scalable approach towards generalizable map prediction can be enabled by using two large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms, Mapillary for FPV images and OpenStreetMap for BEV semantic maps. We introduce Map It Anywhere (MIA), a data engine that enables seamless curation and modeling of labeled map prediction data from existing open-source map platforms. Using our MIA data engine, we display the ease of automatically collecting a dataset of 1.2 million pairs of FPV images & BEV maps encompassing diverse geographies, landscapes, environmental factors, camera models & capture scenarios. We further train a simple camera model-agnostic model on this data for BEV map prediction. Extensive evaluations using established benchmarks and our dataset show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing datasets by 35%. Our analysis highlights the promise of using large-scale public maps for developing & testing generalizable BEV perception, paving the way for more robust autonomous navigation.

Title: Q-GaLore: Quantized GaLore with INT4 Projection and Layer-Adaptive Low-Rank Gradients
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08296
Summary: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is memory-intensive due to the large number of parameters and associated optimization states. GaLore, a recent method, reduces memory usage by projecting weight gradients into a low-rank subspace without compromising performance. However, GaLore relies on time-consuming Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations to identify the subspace, and the frequent subspace updates lead to significant training time overhead. Moreover, GaLore offers minimal improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to LoRA in more accessible fine-tuning scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce Q-Galore, a novel approach that substantially reduces memory usage by combining quantization and low-rank projection, surpassing the benefits of GaLore. Our method is based on two key observations: (i) the gradient subspace exhibits diverse properties, with some layers converging early in training while others are subject to frequent changes; (ii) the projection matrices are highly resilient to low-bit quantization. Leveraging these insights, Q-GaLore adaptively updates the gradient subspace based on its convergence statistics, achieving comparable performance while significantly reducing the number of SVD operations. We maintain the projection matrices in INT4 format and weights in INT8 format, incorporating stochastic rounding to capture accumulated gradient information. This approach enables a high-precision training trajectory using only low-precision weights. We demonstrate that Q-GaLore achieves highly competitive performance with exceptional memory efficiency. At pre-training, Q-GaLore facilitates training a LLaMA-7B model from scratch on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060 Ti with only 16 GB memory. At fine-tuning, it reduces memory consumption by up to 50% compared to LoRA and GaLore, while consistently outperforming QLoRA at the same memory cost.

Title: GTA: A Benchmark for General Tool Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08713
Summary: Significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools in developing general-purpose agents. This poses a challenge to LLMs' tool-use capabilities. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool-use evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only interactions, failing to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for General Tool Agents, featuring three main aspects: (i) Real user queries: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) Real deployed tools: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) Real multimodal inputs: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We design 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which provides future direction for advancing general-purpose tool agents. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/open-compass/GTA.

Title: MAVIS: Mathematical Visual Instruction Tuning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08739
Summary: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently emerged as a significant focus in academia and industry. Despite their proficiency in general multi-modal scenarios, the mathematical problem-solving capabilities in visual contexts remain insufficiently explored. We identify three key areas within MLLMs that need to be improved: visual encoding of math diagrams, diagram-language alignment, and mathematical reasoning skills. This draws forth an urgent demand for large-scale, high-quality data and training pipelines in visual mathematics. In this paper, we propose MAVIS, the first MAthematical VISual instruction tuning paradigm for MLLMs, involving a series of mathematical visual datasets and specialized MLLMs. Targeting the three issues, MAVIS contains three progressive training stages from scratch. First, we curate MAVIS-Caption, consisting of 558K diagram-caption pairs, to fine-tune a math-specific vision encoder (CLIP-Math) through contrastive learning, tailored for improved diagram visual encoding. Second, we utilize MAVIS-Caption to align the CLIP-Math with a large language model (LLM) by a projection layer, enhancing vision-language alignment in mathematical domains. Third, we introduce MAVIS-Instruct, including 900K meticulously collected and annotated visual math problems, which is adopted to finally instruct-tune the MLLM for robust mathematical reasoning skills. In MAVIS-Instruct, we incorporate complete chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales for each problem, and minimize textual redundancy, thereby concentrating the model towards the visual elements. Data and Models are released at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/MAVIS

Title: Skywork-Math: Data Scaling Laws for Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models -- The Story Goes On
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08348
Summary: In this paper, we investigate the underlying factors that potentially enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We argue that the data scaling law for math reasoning capabilities in modern LLMs is far from being saturated, highlighting how the model's quality improves with increases in data quantity. To support this claim, we introduce the Skywork-Math model series, supervised fine-tuned (SFT) on common 7B LLMs using our proposed 2.5M-instance Skywork-MathQA dataset. Skywork-Math 7B has achieved impressive accuracies of 51.2% on the competition-level MATH benchmark and 83.9% on the GSM8K benchmark using only SFT data, outperforming an early version of GPT-4 on MATH. The superior performance of Skywork-Math models contributes to our novel two-stage data synthesis and model SFT pipelines, which include three different augmentation methods and a diverse seed problem set, ensuring both the quantity and quality of Skywork-MathQA dataset across varying difficulty levels. Most importantly, we provide several practical takeaways to enhance math reasoning abilities in LLMs for both research and industry applications.

Title: Video Diffusion Alignment via Reward Gradients
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08737
Summary: We have made significant progress towards building foundational video diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks. Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free approaches. Our code, model weights,and more visualization are available at https://vader-vid.github.io.

Title: OmniNOCS: A unified NOCS dataset and model for 3D lifting of 2D objects
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08711
Summary: We propose OmniNOCS, a large-scale monocular dataset with 3D Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS) maps, object masks, and 3D bounding box annotations for indoor and outdoor scenes. OmniNOCS has 20 times more object classes and 200 times more instances than existing NOCS datasets (NOCS-Real275, Wild6D). We use OmniNOCS to train a novel, transformer-based monocular NOCS prediction model (NOCSformer) that can predict accurate NOCS, instance masks and poses from 2D object detections across diverse classes. It is the first NOCS model that can generalize to a broad range of classes when prompted with 2D boxes. We evaluate our model on the task of 3D oriented bounding box prediction, where it achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art 3D detection methods such as Cube R-CNN. Unlike other 3D detection methods, our model also provides detailed and accurate 3D object shape and segmentation. We propose a novel benchmark for the task of NOCS prediction based on OmniNOCS, which we hope will serve as a useful baseline for future work in this area. Our dataset and code will be at the project website: https://omninocs.github.io.

Title: Live2Diff: Live Stream Translation via Uni-directional Attention in Video Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08701
Summary: Large Language Models have shown remarkable efficacy in generating streaming data such as text and audio, thanks to their temporally uni-directional attention mechanism, which models correlations between the current token and previous tokens. However, video streaming remains much less explored, despite a growing need for live video processing. State-of-the-art video diffusion models leverage bi-directional temporal attention to model the correlations between the current frame and all the surrounding (i.e. including future) frames, which hinders them from processing streaming videos. To address this problem, we present Live2Diff, the first attempt at designing a video diffusion model with uni-directional temporal attention, specifically targeting live streaming video translation. Compared to previous works, our approach ensures temporal consistency and smoothness by correlating the current frame with its predecessors and a few initial warmup frames, without any future frames. Additionally, we use a highly efficient denoising scheme featuring a KV-cache mechanism and pipelining, to facilitate streaming video translation at interactive framerates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attention mechanism and pipeline, outperforming previous methods in terms of temporal smoothness and/or efficiency.

Title: The Synergy between Data and Multi-Modal Large Language Models: A Survey from Co-Development Perspective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08583
Summary: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been witnessed in recent years. Based on the powerful LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains, attracting widespread attention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent capabilities, the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread attention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for MLLMs, we find that the development of models and data is not two separate paths but rather interconnected. On the one hand, vaster and higher-quality data contribute to better performance of MLLMs, on the other hand, MLLMs can facilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stage of MLLMs can specific data-centric approaches be employed to enhance which capabilities, and 2) by utilizing which capabilities and acting as which roles can models contribute to multi-modal data. To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM community, we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective. A regularly maintained project associated with this survey is accessible at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/blob/main/docs/awesome_llm_data.md.

Title: SEED-Story: Multimodal Long Story Generation with Large Language Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08683
Summary: With the remarkable advancements in image generation and open-form text generation, the creation of interleaved image-text content has become an increasingly intriguing field. Multimodal story generation, characterized by producing narrative texts and vivid images in an interleaved manner, has emerged as a valuable and practical task with broad applications. However, this task poses significant challenges, as it necessitates the comprehension of the complex interplay between texts and images, and the ability to generate long sequences of coherent, contextually relevant texts and visuals. In this work, we propose SEED-Story, a novel method that leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate extended multimodal stories. Our model, built upon the powerful comprehension capability of MLLM, predicts text tokens as well as visual tokens, which are subsequently processed with an adapted visual de-tokenizer to produce images with consistent characters and styles. We further propose multimodal attention sink mechanism to enable the generation of stories with up to 25 sequences (only 10 for training) in a highly efficient autoregressive manner. Additionally, we present a large-scale and high-resolution dataset named StoryStream for training our model and quantitatively evaluating the task of multimodal story generation in various aspects.

Title: Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling for Video Frame Interpolation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08680
Summary: Motion modeling is critical in flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI). Existing paradigms either consider linear combinations of bidirectional flows or directly predict bilateral flows for given timestamps without exploring favorable motion priors, thus lacking the capability of effectively modeling spatiotemporal dynamics in real-world videos. To address this limitation, in this study, we introduce Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling (GIMM), a novel and effective approach to motion modeling for VFI. Specifically, to enable GIMM as an effective motion modeling paradigm, we design a motion encoding pipeline to model spatiotemporal motion latent from bidirectional flows extracted from pre-trained flow estimators, effectively representing input-specific motion priors. Then, we implicitly predict arbitrary-timestep optical flows within two adjacent input frames via an adaptive coordinate-based neural network, with spatiotemporal coordinates and motion latent as inputs. Our GIMM can be smoothly integrated with existing flow-based VFI works without further modifications. We show that GIMM performs better than the current state of the art on the VFI benchmarks.

Title: Autoregressive Speech Synthesis without Vector Quantization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08551
Summary: We present MELLE, a novel continuous-valued tokens based language modeling approach for text to speech synthesis (TTS). MELLE autoregressively generates continuous mel-spectrogram frames directly from text condition, bypassing the need for vector quantization, which are originally designed for audio compression and sacrifice fidelity compared to mel-spectrograms. Specifically, (i) instead of cross-entropy loss, we apply regression loss with a proposed spectrogram flux loss function to model the probability distribution of the continuous-valued tokens. (ii) we have incorporated variational inference into MELLE to facilitate sampling mechanisms, thereby enhancing the output diversity and model robustness. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the two-stage codec language models VALL-E and its variants, the single-stage MELLE mitigates robustness issues by avoiding the inherent flaws of sampling discrete codes, achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, and, most importantly, offers a more streamlined paradigm. See https://aka.ms/melle for demos of our work.

Title: WildGaussians: 3D Gaussian Splatting in the Wild
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08447
Summary: While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework.

Title: DenseFusion-1M: Merging Vision Experts for Comprehensive Multimodal Perception
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08303
Summary: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly emphasize complex understanding of various visual elements, including multiple objects, text information, and spatial relations. Their development for comprehensive visual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text datasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions. However, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders progress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited perceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in providing complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge research of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose Perceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for complete and accurate image descriptions. Specifically, Perceptual Fusion integrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit information on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot to mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly representative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense descriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments validate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting dataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of existing MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with high-resolution images as inputs. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/baaivision/DenseFusion.

Title: Gradient Boosting Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08250
Summary: Neural networks (NN) achieve remarkable results in various tasks, but lack key characteristics: interpretability, support for categorical features, and lightweight implementations suitable for edge devices. While ongoing efforts aim to address these challenges, Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) inherently meet these requirements. As a result, GBTs have become the go-to method for supervised learning tasks in many real-world applications and competitions. However, their application in online learning scenarios, notably in reinforcement learning (RL), has been limited. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing Gradient-Boosting RL (GBRL), a framework that extends the advantages of GBT to the RL domain. Using the GBRL framework, we implement various actor-critic algorithms and compare their performance with their NN counterparts. Inspired by shared backbones in NN we introduce a tree-sharing approach for policy and value functions with distinct learning rates, enhancing learning efficiency over millions of interactions. GBRL achieves competitive performance across a diverse array of tasks, excelling in domains with structured or categorical features. Additionally, we present a high-performance, GPU-accelerated implementation that integrates seamlessly with widely-used RL libraries (available at https://github.com/NVlabs/gbrl). GBRL expands the toolkit for RL practitioners, demonstrating the viability and promise of GBT within the RL paradigm, particularly in domains characterized by structured or categorical features.

Title: MambaVision: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08083
Summary: We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone, denoted as MambaVision, which is specifically tailored for vision applications. Our core contribution includes redesigning the Mamba formulation to enhance its capability for efficient modeling of visual features. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study on the feasibility of integrating Vision Transformers (ViT) with Mamba. Our results demonstrate that equipping the Mamba architecture with several self-attention blocks at the final layers greatly improves the modeling capacity to capture long-range spatial dependencies. Based on our findings, we introduce a family of MambaVision models with a hierarchical architecture to meet various design criteria. For Image classification on ImageNet-1K dataset, MambaVision model variants achieve a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance in terms of Top-1 accuracy and image throughput. In downstream tasks such as object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation on MS COCO and ADE20K datasets, MambaVision outperforms comparably-sized backbones and demonstrates more favorable performance.

Title: Still-Moving: Customized Video Generation without Customized Video Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08674
Summary: Customizing text-to-image (T2I) models has seen tremendous progress recently, particularly in areas such as personalization, stylization, and conditional generation. However, expanding this progress to video generation is still in its infancy, primarily due to the lack of customized video data. In this work, we introduce Still-Moving, a novel generic framework for customizing a text-to-video (T2V) model, without requiring any customized video data. The framework applies to the prominent T2V design where the video model is built over a text-to-image (T2I) model (e.g., via inflation). We assume access to a customized version of the T2I model, trained only on still image data (e.g., using DreamBooth or StyleDrop). Naively plugging in the weights of the customized T2I model into the T2V model often leads to significant artifacts or insufficient adherence to the customization data. To overcome this issue, we train lightweight Spatial Adapters that adjust the features produced by the injected T2I layers. Importantly, our adapters are trained on "frozen videos" (i.e., repeated images), constructed from image samples generated by the customized T2I model. This training is facilitated by a novel Motion Adapter module, which allows us to train on such static videos while preserving the motion prior of the video model. At test time, we remove the Motion Adapter modules and leave in only the trained Spatial Adapters. This restores the motion prior of the T2V model while adhering to the spatial prior of the customized T2I model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on diverse tasks including personalized, stylized, and conditional generation. In all evaluated scenarios, our method seamlessly integrates the spatial prior of the customized T2I model with a motion prior supplied by the T2V model.

Title: CrowdMoGen: Zero-Shot Text-Driven Collective Motion Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06188
Summary: Crowd Motion Generation is essential in entertainment industries such as animation and games as well as in strategic fields like urban simulation and planning. This new task requires an intricate integration of control and generation to realistically synthesize crowd dynamics under specific spatial and semantic constraints, whose challenges are yet to be fully explored. On the one hand, existing human motion generation models typically focus on individual behaviors, neglecting the complexities of collective behaviors. On the other hand, recent methods for multi-person motion generation depend heavily on pre-defined scenarios and are limited to a fixed, small number of inter-person interactions, thus hampering their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce CrowdMoGen, a zero-shot text-driven framework that harnesses the power of Large Language Model (LLM) to incorporate the collective intelligence into the motion generation framework as guidance, thereby enabling generalizable planning and generation of crowd motions without paired training data. Our framework consists of two key components: 1) Crowd Scene Planner that learns to coordinate motions and dynamics according to specific scene contexts or introduced perturbations, and 2) Collective Motion Generator that efficiently synthesizes the required collective motions based on the holistic plans. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have validated the effectiveness of our framework, which not only fills a critical gap by providing scalable and generalizable solutions for Crowd Motion Generation task but also achieves high levels of realism and flexibility.

Title: Do Vision and Language Models Share Concepts? A Vector Space Alignment Study
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06555
Summary: Large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) are said to ``lack the ability to connect utterances to the world'' (Bender and Koller, 2020), because they do not have ``mental models of the world' '(Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023). If so, one would expect LM representations to be unrelated to representations induced by vision models. We present an empirical evaluation across four families of LMs (BERT, GPT-2, OPT and LLaMA-2) and three vision model architectures (ResNet, SegFormer, and MAE). Our experiments show that LMs partially converge towards representations isomorphic to those of vision models, subject to dispersion, polysemy and frequency. This has important implications for both multi-modal processing and the LM understanding debate (Mitchell and Krakauer, 2023).

Title: This&That: Language-Gesture Controlled Video Generation for Robot Planning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05530
Summary: We propose a robot learning method for communicating, planning, and executing a wide range of tasks, dubbed This&That. We achieve robot planning for general tasks by leveraging the power of video generative models trained on internet-scale data containing rich physical and semantic context. In this work, we tackle three fundamental challenges in video-based planning: 1) unambiguous task communication with simple human instructions, 2) controllable video generation that respects user intents, and 3) translating visual planning into robot actions. We propose language-gesture conditioning to generate videos, which is both simpler and clearer than existing language-only methods, especially in complex and uncertain environments. We then suggest a behavioral cloning design that seamlessly incorporates the video plans. This&That demonstrates state-of-the-art effectiveness in addressing the above three challenges, and justifies the use of video generation as an intermediate representation for generalizable task planning and execution.

Summary: In this paper we consider contamination by code generation test sets, in particular in their use in modern large language models. We discuss three possible sources of such contamination and show findings supporting each of them: (i) direct data leakage, (ii) indirect data leakage through the use of synthetic data and (iii) overfitting to evaluation sets during model selection.   Key to our findings is a new dataset of 161 prompts with their associated python solutions, dataset which is released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/CohereForAI/lbpp .

PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07315
Summary: Existing vision-text contrastive learning models enhance representation transferability and support zero-shot prediction by matching paired image and caption embeddings while pushing unrelated pairs apart. However, astronomical image-label datasets are significantly smaller compared to general image and label datasets available from the internet. We introduce CosmoCLIP, an astronomical image-text contrastive learning framework precisely fine-tuned on the pre-trained CLIP model using SpaceNet and BLIP-based captions. SpaceNet, attained via FLARE, constitutes ~13k optimally distributed images, while BLIP acts as a rich knowledge extractor. The rich semantics derived from this SpaceNet and BLIP descriptions, when learned contrastively, enable CosmoCLIP to achieve superior generalization across various in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Our results demonstrate that CosmoCLIP is a straightforward yet powerful framework, significantly outperforming CLIP in zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval tasks.

Title: An accurate detection is not all you need to combat label noise in web-noisy datasets
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05528
Summary: Training a classifier on web-crawled data demands learning algorithms that are robust to annotation errors and irrelevant examples. This paper builds upon the recent empirical observation that applying unsupervised contrastive learning to noisy, web-crawled datasets yields a feature representation under which the in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are linearly separable. We show that direct estimation of the separating hyperplane can indeed offer an accurate detection of OOD samples, and yet, surprisingly, this detection does not translate into gains in classification accuracy. Digging deeper into this phenomenon, we discover that the near-perfect detection misses a type of clean examples that are valuable for supervised learning. These examples often represent visually simple images, which are relatively easy to identify as clean examples using standard loss- or distance-based methods despite being poorly separated from the OOD distribution using unsupervised learning. Because we further observe a low correlation with SOTA metrics, this urges us to propose a hybrid solution that alternates between noise detection using linear separation and a state-of-the-art (SOTA) small-loss approach. When combined with the SOTA algorithm PLS, we substantially improve SOTA results for real-world image classification in the presence of web noise github.com/PaulAlbert31/LSA

Title: LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave: Tackling Multi-image, Video, and 3D in Large Multimodal Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07895
Summary: Visual instruction tuning has made considerable strides in enhancing the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, existing open LMMs largely focus on single-image tasks, their applications to multi-image scenarios remains less explored. Additionally, prior LMM research separately tackles different scenarios, leaving it impossible to generalize cross scenarios with new emerging capabilities. To this end, we introduce LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave, which simultaneously tackles Multi-image, Multi-frame (video), Multi-view (3D), and Multi-patch (single-image) scenarios in LMMs. To enable these capabilities, we regard the interleaved data format as a general template and compile the M4-Instruct dataset with 1,177.6k samples, spanning 4 primary domains with 14 tasks and 41 datasets. We also curate the LLaVA-Interleave Bench to comprehensively evaluate the multi-image performance of LMMs. Through extensive experiments, LLaVA-NeXT-Interleave achieves leading results in multi-image, video, and 3D benchmarks, while maintaining the performance of single-image tasks. Besides, our model also exhibits several emerging capabilities, e.g., transferring tasks across different settings and modalities. Code is available at https://github.com/LLaVA-VL/LLaVA-NeXT

Title: Controlling Space and Time with Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07860
Summary: We present 4DiM, a cascaded diffusion model for 4D novel view synthesis (NVS), conditioned on one or more images of a general scene, and a set of camera poses and timestamps. To overcome challenges due to limited availability of 4D training data, we advocate joint training on 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data and propose a new architecture that enables the same. We further advocate the calibration of SfM posed data using monocular metric depth estimators for metric scale camera control. For model evaluation, we introduce new metrics to enrich and overcome shortcomings of current evaluation schemes, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both fidelity and pose control compared to existing diffusion models for 3D NVS, while at the same time adding the ability to handle temporal dynamics. 4DiM is also used for improved panorama stitching, pose-conditioned video to video translation, and several other tasks.

Title: Inference Performance Optimization for Large Language Models on CPUs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07304
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance and vast potential across diverse tasks. However, the deployment of LLMs with high performance in low-resource environments has garnered significant attention in the industry. When GPU hardware resources are limited, we can explore alternative options on CPUs. To mitigate the financial burden and alleviate constraints imposed by hardware resources, optimizing inference performance is necessary. In this paper, we introduce an easily deployable inference performance optimization solution aimed at accelerating LLMs on CPUs. In this solution, we implement an effective way to reduce the KV cache size while ensuring precision. We propose a distributed inference optimization approach and implement it based on oneAPI Collective Communications Library. Furthermore, we propose optimization approaches for LLMs on CPU, and conduct tailored optimizations for the most commonly used models. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/intel/xFasterTransformer.

Title: VEnhancer: Generative Space-Time Enhancement for Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07667
Summary: We present VEnhancer, a generative space-time enhancement framework that improves the existing text-to-video results by adding more details in spatial domain and synthetic detailed motion in temporal domain. Given a generated low-quality video, our approach can increase its spatial and temporal resolution simultaneously with arbitrary up-sampling space and time scales through a unified video diffusion model. Furthermore, VEnhancer effectively removes generated spatial artifacts and temporal flickering of generated videos. To achieve this, basing on a pretrained video diffusion model, we train a video ControlNet and inject it to the diffusion model as a condition on low frame-rate and low-resolution videos. To effectively train this video ControlNet, we design space-time data augmentation as well as video-aware conditioning. Benefiting from the above designs, VEnhancer yields to be stable during training and shares an elegant end-to-end training manner. Extensive experiments show that VEnhancer surpasses existing state-of-the-art video super-resolution and space-time super-resolution methods in enhancing AI-generated videos. Moreover, with VEnhancer, exisiting open-source state-of-the-art text-to-video method, VideoCrafter-2, reaches the top one in video generation benchmark -- VBench.

Title: Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07464
Summary: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.

Title: LETS-C: Leveraging Language Embedding for Time Series Classification
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06533
Summary: Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.

Title: TheoremLlama: Transforming General-Purpose LLMs into Lean4 Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03203
Summary: Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning. One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation. However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data. This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert. This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning. The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%. We have also open-sourced our model checkpoints and generated dataset, and will soon make all the code publicly available.

Title: BM25S: Orders of magnitude faster lexical search via eager sparse scoring
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03618
Summary: We introduce BM25S, an efficient Python-based implementation of BM25 that only depends on Numpy and Scipy. BM25S achieves up to a 500x speedup compared to the most popular Python-based framework by eagerly computing BM25 scores during indexing and storing them into sparse matrices. It also achieves considerable speedups compared to highly optimized Java-based implementations, which are used by popular commercial products. Finally, BM25S reproduces the exact implementation of five BM25 variants based on Kamphuis et al. (2020) by extending eager scoring to non-sparse variants using a novel score shifting method. The code can be found at https://github.com/xhluca/bm25s

Title: Graph-Based Captioning: Enhancing Visual Descriptions by Interconnecting Region Captions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06723
Summary: Humans describe complex scenes with compositionality, using simple text descriptions enriched with links and relationships. While vision-language research has aimed to develop models with compositional understanding capabilities, this is not reflected yet in existing datasets which, for the most part, still use plain text to describe images. In this work, we propose a new annotation strategy, graph-based captioning (GBC) that describes an image using a labelled graph structure, with nodes of various types. The nodes in GBC are created using, in a first stage, object detection and dense captioning tools nested recursively to uncover and describe entity nodes, further linked together in a second stage by highlighting, using new types of nodes, compositions and relations among entities. Since all GBC nodes hold plain text descriptions, GBC retains the flexibility found in natural language, but can also encode hierarchical information in its edges. We demonstrate that GBC can be produced automatically, using off-the-shelf multimodal LLMs and open-vocabulary detection models, by building a new dataset, GBC10M, gathering GBC annotations for about 10M images of the CC12M dataset. We use GBC10M to showcase the wealth of node captions uncovered by GBC, as measured with CLIP training. We show that using GBC nodes' annotations -- notably those stored in composition and relation nodes -- results in significant performance boost on downstream models when compared to other dataset formats. To further explore the opportunities provided by GBC, we also propose a new attention mechanism that can leverage the entire GBC graph, with encouraging experimental results that show the extra benefits of incorporating the graph structure. Our datasets are released at https://huggingface.co/graph-based-captions.

Title: Adapting LLMs to Hebrew: Unveiling DictaLM 2.0 with Enhanced Vocabulary and Instruction Capabilities
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07080
Summary: Training large language models (LLMs) in low-resource languages such as Hebrew poses unique challenges. In this paper, we introduce DictaLM2.0 and DictaLM2.0-Instruct, two LLMs derived from the Mistral model, trained on a substantial corpus of approximately 200 billion tokens in both Hebrew and English. Adapting a pre-trained model to a new language involves specialized techniques that differ significantly from training a model from scratch or further training existing models on well-resourced languages such as English. We outline these novel training methodologies, which facilitate effective learning and adaptation to the linguistic properties of Hebrew. Additionally, we fine-tuned DictaLM2.0-Instruct on a comprehensive instruct dataset to enhance its performance on task-specific instructions. To rigorously evaluate our models, we introduce a new benchmark suite for Hebrew LLM evaluation, covering a diverse set of tasks including Question Answering, Sentiment Analysis, Winograd Schema Challenge, Translation, and Summarization. Our work not only addresses the intricacies of training LLMs in low-resource languages but also proposes a framework that can be leveraged for adapting other LLMs to various non-English languages, contributing to the broader field of multilingual NLP.

Title: Knowledge Composition using Task Vectors with Learned Anisotropic Scaling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02880
Summary: Pre-trained models produce strong generic representations that can be adapted via fine-tuning. The learned weight difference relative to the pre-trained model, known as a task vector, characterises the direction and stride of fine-tuning. The significance of task vectors is such that simple arithmetic operations on them can be used to combine diverse representations from different domains. This paper builds on these properties of task vectors and aims to answer (1) whether components of task vectors, particularly parameter blocks, exhibit similar characteristics, and (2) how such blocks can be used to enhance knowledge composition and transfer. To this end, we introduce aTLAS, an algorithm that linearly combines parameter blocks with different learned coefficients, resulting in anisotropic scaling at the task vector level. We show that such linear combinations explicitly exploit the low intrinsic dimensionality of pre-trained models, with only a few coefficients being the learnable parameters. Furthermore, composition of parameter blocks leverages the already learned representations, thereby reducing the dependency on large amounts of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in task arithmetic, few-shot recognition and test-time adaptation, with supervised or unsupervised objectives. In particular, we show that (1) learned anisotropic scaling allows task vectors to be more disentangled, causing less interference in composition; (2) task vector composition excels with scarce or no labeled data and is less prone to domain shift, thus leading to better generalisability; (3) mixing the most informative parameter blocks across different task vectors prior to training can reduce the memory footprint and improve the flexibility of knowledge transfer. Moreover, we show the potential of aTLAS as a PEFT method, particularly with less data, and demonstrate that its scalibility.

Title: How do you know that? Teaching Generative Language Models to Reference Answers to Biomedical Questions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05015
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have recently become the leading source of answers for users' questions online. Despite their ability to offer eloquent answers, their accuracy and reliability can pose a significant challenge. This is especially true for sensitive domains such as biomedicine, where there is a higher need for factually correct answers. This paper introduces a biomedical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to enhance the reliability of generated responses. The system is based on a fine-tuned LLM for the referenced question-answering, where retrieved relevant abstracts from PubMed are passed to LLM's context as input through a prompt. Its output is an answer based on PubMed abstracts, where each statement is referenced accordingly, allowing the users to verify the answer. Our retrieval system achieves an absolute improvement of 23% compared to the PubMed search engine. Based on the manual evaluation on a small sample, our fine-tuned LLM component achieves comparable results to GPT-4 Turbo in referencing relevant abstracts. We make the dataset used to fine-tune the models and the fine-tuned models based on Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.1 and v0.2 publicly available.

Title: From Loops to Oops: Fallback Behaviors of Language Models Under Uncertainty
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06071
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as hallucinations and sequence repetitions. We propose to view these behaviors as fallbacks that models exhibit under uncertainty, and investigate the connection between them. We categorize fallback behaviors -- sequence repetitions, degenerate text, and hallucinations -- and extensively analyze them in models from the same family that differ by the amount of pretraining tokens, parameter count, or the inclusion of instruction-following training. Our experiments reveal a clear and consistent ordering of fallback behaviors, across all these axes: the more advanced an LLM is (i.e., trained on more tokens, has more parameters, or instruction-tuned), its fallback behavior shifts from sequence repetitions, to degenerate text, and then to hallucinations. Moreover, the same ordering is observed throughout a single generation, even for the best-performing models; as uncertainty increases, models shift from generating hallucinations to producing degenerate text and then sequence repetitions. Lastly, we demonstrate that while common decoding techniques, such as random sampling, might alleviate some unwanted behaviors like sequence repetitions, they increase harder-to-detect hallucinations.

Title: AgentInstruct: Toward Generative Teaching with Agentic Flows
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03502
Summary: Synthetic data is becoming increasingly important for accelerating the development of language models, both large and small. Despite several successful use cases, researchers also raised concerns around model collapse and drawbacks of imitating other models. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that synthetic data varies in quality and diversity. Effective use of synthetic data usually requires significant human effort in curating the data. We focus on using synthetic data for post-training, specifically creating data by powerful models to teach a new skill or behavior to another model, we refer to this setting as Generative Teaching. We introduce AgentInstruct, an extensible agentic framework for automatically creating large amounts of diverse and high-quality synthetic data. AgentInstruct can create both the prompts and responses, using only raw data sources like text documents and code files as seeds. We demonstrate the utility of AgentInstruct by creating a post training dataset of 25M pairs to teach language models different skills, such as text editing, creative writing, tool usage, coding, reading comprehension, etc. The dataset can be used for instruction tuning of any base model. We post-train Mistral-7b with the data. When comparing the resulting model Orca-3 to Mistral-7b-Instruct (which uses the same base model), we observe significant improvements across many benchmarks. For example, 40% improvement on AGIEval, 19% improvement on MMLU, 54% improvement on GSM8K, 38% improvement on BBH and 45% improvement on AlpacaEval. Additionally, it consistently outperforms other models such as LLAMA-8B-instruct and GPT-3.5-turbo.

Title: Internet of Agents: Weaving a Web of Heterogeneous Agents for Collaborative Intelligence
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07061
Summary: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking diverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly collaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities. Our codebase has been released at https://github.com/OpenBMB/IoA.

Title: RodinHD: High-Fidelity 3D Avatar Generation with Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06938
Summary: We present RodinHD, which can generate high-fidelity 3D avatars from a portrait image. Existing methods fail to capture intricate details such as hairstyles which we tackle in this paper. We first identify an overlooked problem of catastrophic forgetting that arises when fitting triplanes sequentially on many avatars, caused by the MLP decoder sharing scheme. To overcome this issue, we raise a novel data scheduling strategy and a weight consolidation regularization term, which improves the decoder's capability of rendering sharper details. Additionally, we optimize the guiding effect of the portrait image by computing a finer-grained hierarchical representation that captures rich 2D texture cues, and injecting them to the 3D diffusion model at multiple layers via cross-attention. When trained on 46K avatars with a noise schedule optimized for triplanes, the resulting model can generate 3D avatars with notably better details than previous methods and can generalize to in-the-wild portrait input.

Title: Vision language models are blind
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06581
Summary: Large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs), e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro are powering countless image-text applications and scoring high on many vision-understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that VLMs fail on 7 visual tasks absurdly easy to humans such as identifying (a) whether two circles overlap; (b) whether two lines intersect; (c) which letter is being circled in a word; and (d) counting the number of circles in a Olympic-like logo. The shockingly poor performance of four state-of-the-art VLMs suggests their vision is, at best, like of a person with myopia seeing fine details as blurry, and at worst, like an intelligent person that is blind making educated guesses.

Title: Video-STaR: Self-Training Enables Video Instruction Tuning with Any Supervision
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06189
Summary: The performance of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) is dependent on the size and quality of their training datasets. Existing video instruction tuning datasets lack diversity as they are derived by prompting large language models with video captions to generate question-answer pairs, and are therefore mostly descriptive. Meanwhile, many labeled video datasets with diverse labels and supervision exist - however, we find that their integration into LVLMs is non-trivial. Herein, we present Video Self-Training with augmented Reasoning (Video-STaR), the first video self-training approach. Video-STaR allows the utilization of any labeled video dataset for video instruction tuning. In Video-STaR, an LVLM cycles between instruction generation and finetuning, which we show (I) improves general video understanding and (II) adapts LVLMs to novel downstream tasks with existing supervision. During generation, an LVLM is prompted to propose an answer. The answers are then filtered only to those that contain the original video labels, and the LVLM is then re-trained on the generated dataset. By only training on generated answers that contain the correct video labels, Video-STaR utilizes these existing video labels as weak supervision for video instruction tuning. Our results demonstrate that Video-STaR-enhanced LVLMs exhibit improved performance in (I) general video QA, where TempCompass performance improved by 10%, and (II) on downstream tasks, where Video-STaR improved Kinetics700-QA accuracy by 20% and action quality assessment on FineDiving by 15%.

Title: MiraData: A Large-Scale Video Dataset with Long Durations and Structured Captions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06358
Summary: Sora's high-motion intensity and long consistent videos have significantly impacted the field of video generation, attracting unprecedented attention. However, existing publicly available datasets are inadequate for generating Sora-like videos, as they mainly contain short videos with low motion intensity and brief captions. To address these issues, we propose MiraData, a high-quality video dataset that surpasses previous ones in video duration, caption detail, motion strength, and visual quality. We curate MiraData from diverse, manually selected sources and meticulously process the data to obtain semantically consistent clips. GPT-4V is employed to annotate structured captions, providing detailed descriptions from four different perspectives along with a summarized dense caption. To better assess temporal consistency and motion intensity in video generation, we introduce MiraBench, which enhances existing benchmarks by adding 3D consistency and tracking-based motion strength metrics. MiraBench includes 150 evaluation prompts and 17 metrics covering temporal consistency, motion strength, 3D consistency, visual quality, text-video alignment, and distribution similarity. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of MiraData, we conduct experiments using our DiT-based video generation model, MiraDiT. The experimental results on MiraBench demonstrate the superiority of MiraData, especially in motion strength.

Title: VIMI: Grounding Video Generation through Multi-modal Instruction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06304
Summary: Existing text-to-video diffusion models rely solely on text-only encoders for their pretraining. This limitation stems from the absence of large-scale multimodal prompt video datasets, resulting in a lack of visual grounding and restricting their versatility and application in multimodal integration. To address this, we construct a large-scale multimodal prompt dataset by employing retrieval methods to pair in-context examples with the given text prompts and then utilize a two-stage training strategy to enable diverse video generation tasks within the same model. In the first stage, we propose a multimodal conditional video generation framework for pretraining on these augmented datasets, establishing a foundational model for grounded video generation. Secondly, we finetune the model from the first stage on three video generation tasks, incorporating multi-modal instructions. This process further refines the model's ability to handle diverse inputs and tasks, ensuring seamless integration of multi-modal information. After this two-stage train-ing process, VIMI demonstrates multimodal understanding capabilities, producing contextually rich and personalized videos grounded in the provided inputs, as shown in Figure 1. Compared to previous visual grounded video generation methods, VIMI can synthesize consistent and temporally coherent videos with large motion while retaining the semantic control. Lastly, VIMI also achieves state-of-the-art text-to-video generation results on UCF101 benchmark.
