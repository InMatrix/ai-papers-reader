Title: Unboxing Occupational Bias: Grounded Debiasing LLMs with U.S. Labor Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11247
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to inheriting and amplifying societal biases embedded within their training data, potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes related to gender, occupation, and other sensitive categories. This issue becomes particularly problematic as biased LLMs can have far-reaching consequences, leading to unfair practices and exacerbating social inequalities across various domains, such as recruitment, online content moderation, or even the criminal justice system. Although prior research has focused on detecting bias in LLMs using specialized datasets designed to highlight intrinsic biases, there has been a notable lack of investigation into how these findings correlate with authoritative datasets, such as those from the U.S. National Bureau of Labor Statistics (NBLS). To address this gap, we conduct empirical research that evaluates LLMs in a ``bias-out-of-the-box" setting, analyzing how the generated outputs compare with the distributions found in NBLS data. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward yet effective debiasing mechanism that directly incorporates NBLS instances to mitigate bias within LLMs. Our study spans seven different LLMs, including instructable, base, and mixture-of-expert models, and reveals significant levels of bias that are often overlooked by existing bias detection techniques. Importantly, our debiasing method, which does not rely on external datasets, demonstrates a substantial reduction in bias scores, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in creating fairer and more reliable LLMs.

Title: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Attention Head Masking for Multimodal Document Classification
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11237
Summary: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is crucial in machine learning applications to mitigate the risk of model overconfidence, thereby enhancing the reliability and safety of deployed systems. The majority of existing OOD detection methods predominantly address uni-modal inputs, such as images or texts. In the context of multi-modal documents, there is a notable lack of extensive research on the performance of these methods, which have primarily been developed with a focus on computer vision tasks. We propose a novel methodology termed as attention head masking (AHM) for multi-modal OOD tasks in document classification systems. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed AHM method outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches and significantly decreases the false positive rate (FPR) compared to existing solutions up to 7.5\%. This methodology generalizes well to multi-modal data, such as documents, where visual and textual information are modeled under the same Transformer architecture. To address the scarcity of high-quality publicly available document datasets and encourage further research on OOD detection for documents, we introduce FinanceDocs, a new document AI dataset. Our code and dataset are publicly available.

Title: Iterative Object Count Optimization for Text-to-image Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11721
Summary: We address a persistent challenge in text-to-image models: accurately generating a specified number of objects. Current models, which learn from image-text pairs, inherently struggle with counting, as training data cannot depict every possible number of objects for any given object. To solve this, we propose optimizing the generated image based on a counting loss derived from a counting model that aggregates an object\'s potential. Employing an out-of-the-box counting model is challenging for two reasons: first, the model requires a scaling hyperparameter for the potential aggregation that varies depending on the viewpoint of the objects, and second, classifier guidance techniques require modified models that operate on noisy intermediate diffusion steps. To address these challenges, we propose an iterated online training mode that improves the accuracy of inferred images while altering the text conditioning embedding and dynamically adjusting hyperparameters. Our method offers three key advantages: (i) it can consider non-derivable counting techniques based on detection models, (ii) it is a zero-shot plug-and-play solution facilitating rapid changes to the counting techniques and image generation methods, and (iii) the optimized counting token can be reused to generate accurate images without additional optimization. We evaluate the generation of various objects and show significant improvements in accuracy. The project page is available at https://ozzafar.github.io/count_token.

Title: Scaling Cross-Embodied Learning: One Policy for Manipulation, Navigation, Locomotion and Aviation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11812
Summary: Modern machine learning systems rely on large datasets to attain broad generalization, and this often poses a challenge in robot learning, where each robotic platform and task might have only a small dataset. By training a single policy across many different kinds of robots, a robot learning method can leverage much broader and more diverse datasets, which in turn can lead to better generalization and robustness. However, training a single policy on multi-robot data is challenging because robots can have widely varying sensors, actuators, and control frequencies. We propose CrossFormer, a scalable and flexible transformer-based policy that can consume data from any embodiment. We train CrossFormer on the largest and most diverse dataset to date, 900K trajectories across 20 different robot embodiments. We demonstrate that the same network weights can control vastly different robots, including single and dual arm manipulation systems, wheeled robots, quadcopters, and quadrupeds. Unlike prior work, our model does not require manual alignment of the observation or action spaces. Extensive experiments in the real world show that our method matches the performance of specialist policies tailored for each embodiment, while also significantly outperforming the prior state of the art in cross-embodiment learning.

Title: Backward-Compatible Aligned Representations via an Orthogonal Transformation Layer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08793
Summary: Visual retrieval systems face significant challenges when updating models with improved representations due to misalignment between the old and new representations. The costly and resource-intensive backfilling process involves recalculating feature vectors for images in the gallery set whenever a new model is introduced. To address this, prior research has explored backward-compatible training methods that enable direct comparisons between new and old representations without backfilling. Despite these advancements, achieving a balance between backward compatibility and the performance of independently trained models remains an open problem. In this paper, we address it by expanding the representation space with additional dimensions and learning an orthogonal transformation to achieve compatibility with old models and, at the same time, integrate new information. This transformation preserves the original feature space's geometry, ensuring that our model aligns with previous versions while also learning new data. Our Orthogonal Compatible Aligned (OCA) approach eliminates the need for re-indexing during model updates and ensures that features can be compared directly across different model updates without additional mapping functions. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that our method not only maintains compatibility with previous models but also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming several existing methods.

Title: FRAP: Faithful and Realistic Text-to-Image Generation with Adaptive Prompt Weighting
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11706
Summary: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images given a text prompt. However, ensuring the prompt-image alignment remains a considerable challenge, i.e., generating images that faithfully align with the prompt's semantics. Recent works attempt to improve the faithfulness by optimizing the latent code, which potentially could cause the latent code to go out-of-distribution and thus produce unrealistic images. In this paper, we propose FRAP, a simple, yet effective approach based on adaptively adjusting the per-token prompt weights to improve prompt-image alignment and authenticity of the generated images. We design an online algorithm to adaptively update each token's weight coefficient, which is achieved by minimizing a unified objective function that encourages object presence and the binding of object-modifier pairs. Through extensive evaluations, we show FRAP generates images with significantly higher prompt-image alignment to prompts from complex datasets, while having a lower average latency compared to recent latent code optimization methods, e.g., 4 seconds faster than D&B on the COCO-Subject dataset. Furthermore, through visual comparisons and evaluation on the CLIP-IQA-Real metric, we show that FRAP not only improves prompt-image alignment but also generates more authentic images with realistic appearances. We also explore combining FRAP with prompt rewriting LLM to recover their degraded prompt-image alignment, where we observe improvements in both prompt-image alignment and image quality.

Title: GRAB: A Challenging GRaph Analysis Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11817
Summary: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is entirely synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 2170 questions, covering four tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.7%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.

Title: Expanding FLORES+ Benchmark for more Low-Resource Settings: Portuguese-Emakhuwa Machine Translation Evaluation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11457
Summary: As part of the Open Language Data Initiative shared tasks, we have expanded the FLORES+ evaluation set to include Emakhuwa, a low-resource language widely spoken in Mozambique. We translated the dev and devtest sets from Portuguese into Emakhuwa, and we detail the translation process and quality assurance measures used. Our methodology involved various quality checks, including post-editing and adequacy assessments. The resulting datasets consist of multiple reference sentences for each source. We present baseline results from training a Neural Machine Translation system and fine-tuning existing multilingual translation models. Our findings suggest that spelling inconsistencies remain a challenge in Emakhuwa. Additionally, the baseline models underperformed on this evaluation set, underscoring the necessity for further research to enhance machine translation quality for Emakhuwa. The data is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/LIACC/Emakhuwa-FLORES.

Title: LLM Pruning and Distillation in Practice: The Minitron Approach
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11796
Summary: We present a comprehensive report on compressing the Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral NeMo 12B models to 4B and 8B parameters, respectively, using pruning and distillation. We explore two distinct pruning strategies: (1) depth pruning and (2) joint hidden/attention/MLP (width) pruning, and evaluate the results on common benchmarks from the LM Evaluation Harness. The models are then aligned with NeMo Aligner and tested in instruct-tuned versions. This approach produces a compelling 4B model from Llama 3.1 8B and a state-of-the-art Mistral-NeMo-Minitron-8B (MN-Minitron-8B for brevity) model from Mistral NeMo 12B. We found that with no access to the original data, it is beneficial to slightly fine-tune teacher models on the distillation dataset. We open-source our base model weights on Hugging Face with a permissive license.

Title: FocusLLM: Scaling LLM's Context by Parallel Decoding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11745
Summary: Empowering LLMs with the ability to utilize useful information from a long context is crucial for many downstream applications. However, achieving long context lengths with the conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. In this paper, we present FocusLLM, a framework designed to extend the context length of any decoder-only LLM, enabling the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM processes long text inputs by dividing them into chunks based on the model's original context length to alleviate the issue of attention distraction. Then, it appends the local context to each chunk as a prompt to extract essential information from each chunk based on a novel parallel decoding mechanism, and ultimately integrates the extracted information into the local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream long-context tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens. Our code is available at https://github.com/leezythu/FocusLLM.

Title: TWLV-I: Analysis and Insights from Holistic Evaluation on Video Foundation Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11318
Summary: In this work, we discuss evaluating video foundation models in a fair and robust manner. Unlike language or image foundation models, many video foundation models are evaluated with differing parameters (such as sampling rate, number of frames, pretraining steps, etc.), making fair and robust comparisons challenging. Therefore, we present a carefully designed evaluation framework for measuring two core capabilities of video comprehension: appearance and motion understanding. Our findings reveal that existing video foundation models, whether text-supervised like UMT or InternVideo2, or self-supervised like V-JEPA, exhibit limitations in at least one of these capabilities. As an alternative, we introduce TWLV-I, a new video foundation model that constructs robust visual representations for both motion- and appearance-based videos. Based on the average top-1 accuracy of linear probing on five action recognition benchmarks, pretrained only on publicly accessible datasets, our model shows a 4.6%p improvement compared to V-JEPA (ViT-L) and a 7.7%p improvement compared to UMT (ViT-L). Even when compared to much larger models, our model demonstrates a 7.2%p improvement compared to DFN (ViT-H), a 2.7%p improvement compared to V-JEPA~(ViT-H) and a 2.8%p improvement compared to InternVideo2 (ViT-g). We provide embedding vectors obtained by TWLV-I from videos of several commonly used video benchmarks, along with evaluation source code that can directly utilize these embeddings. The code is available on "https://github.com/twelvelabs-io/video-embeddings-evaluation-framework".

Title: TrackGo: A Flexible and Efficient Method for Controllable Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11475
Summary: Recent years have seen substantial progress in diffusion-based controllable video generation. However, achieving precise control in complex scenarios, including fine-grained object parts, sophisticated motion trajectories, and coherent background movement, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce TrackGo, a novel approach that leverages free-form masks and arrows for conditional video generation. This method offers users with a flexible and precise mechanism for manipulating video content. We also propose the TrackAdapter for control implementation, an efficient and lightweight adapter designed to be seamlessly integrated into the temporal self-attention layers of a pretrained video generation model. This design leverages our observation that the attention map of these layers can accurately activate regions corresponding to motion in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new approach, enhanced by the TrackAdapter, achieves state-of-the-art performance on key metrics such as FVD, FID, and ObjMC scores.

Title: NeCo: Improving DINOv2's spatial representations in 19 GPU hours with Patch Neighbor Consistency
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11054
Summary: We propose sorting patch representations across views as a novel self-supervised learning signal to improve pretrained representations. To this end, we introduce NeCo: Patch Neighbor Consistency, a novel training loss that enforces patch-level nearest neighbor consistency across a student and teacher model, relative to reference batches. Our method leverages a differentiable sorting method applied on top of pretrained representations, such as DINOv2-registers to bootstrap the learning signal and further improve upon them. This dense post-pretraining leads to superior performance across various models and datasets, despite requiring only 19 hours on a single GPU. We demonstrate that this method generates high-quality dense feature encoders and establish several new state-of-the-art results: +5.5% and + 6% for non-parametric in-context semantic segmentation on ADE20k and Pascal VOC, and +7.2% and +5.7% for linear segmentation evaluations on COCO-Things and -Stuff.

Summary: The specialized language and complex concepts in physics pose significant challenges for information extraction through Natural Language Processing (NLP). Central to effective NLP applications is the text embedding model, which converts text into dense vector representations for efficient information retrieval and semantic analysis. In this work, we introduce PhysBERT, the first physics-specific text embedding model. Pre-trained on a curated corpus of 1.2 million arXiv physics papers and fine-tuned with supervised data, PhysBERT outperforms leading general-purpose models on physics-specific tasks including the effectiveness in fine-tuning for specific physics subdomains.

Title: Recent Surge in Public Interest in Transportation: Sentiment Analysis of Baidu Apollo Go Using Weibo Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10088
Summary: Urban mobility and transportation systems have been profoundly transformed by the advancement of autonomous vehicle technologies. Baidu Apollo Go, a pioneer robotaxi service from the Chinese tech giant Baidu, has recently been widely deployed in major cities like Beijing and Wuhan, sparking increased conversation and offering a glimpse into the future of urban mobility.   This study investigates public attitudes towards Apollo Go across China using Sentiment Analysis with a hybrid BERT model on 36,096 Weibo posts from January to July 2024. The analysis shows that 89.56\% of posts related to Apollo Go are clustered in July. From January to July, public sentiment was mostly positive, but negative comments began to rise after it became a hot topic on July 21.   Spatial analysis indicates a strong correlation between provinces with high discussion intensity and those where Apollo Go operates. Initially, Hubei and Guangdong dominated online posting volume, but by July, Guangdong, Beijing, and international regions had overtaken Hubei. Attitudes varied significantly among provinces, with Xinjiang and Qinghai showing optimism and Tibet and Gansu expressing concerns about the impact on traditional taxi services.   Sentiment analysis revealed that positive comments focused on technology applications and personal experiences, while negative comments centered on job displacement and safety concerns. In summary, this study highlights the divergence in public perceptions of autonomous ride-hailing services, providing valuable insights for planners, policymakers, and service providers. The model is published on Hugging Face at https://huggingface.co/wsqstar/bert-finetuned-weibo-luobokuaipao and the repository on GitHub at https://github.com/GIStudio/trb2024.

Title: Ferret: Faster and Effective Automated Red Teaming with Reward-Based Scoring Technique
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10701
Summary: In today's era, where large language models (LLMs) are integrated into numerous real-world applications, ensuring their safety and robustness is crucial for responsible AI usage. Automated red-teaming methods play a key role in this process by generating adversarial attacks to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in these models. However, existing methods often struggle with slow performance, limited categorical diversity, and high resource demands. While Rainbow Teaming, a recent approach, addresses the diversity challenge by framing adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity search, it remains slow and requires a large fine-tuned mutator for optimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Ferret, a novel approach that builds upon Rainbow Teaming by generating multiple adversarial prompt mutations per iteration and using a scoring function to rank and select the most effective adversarial prompt. We explore various scoring functions, including reward models, Llama Guard, and LLM-as-a-judge, to rank adversarial mutations based on their potential harm to improve the efficiency of the search for harmful mutations. Our results demonstrate that Ferret, utilizing a reward model as a scoring function, improves the overall attack success rate (ASR) to 95%, which is 46% higher than Rainbow Teaming. Additionally, Ferret reduces the time needed to achieve a 90% ASR by 15.2% compared to the baseline and generates adversarial prompts that are transferable i.e. effective on other LLMs of larger size. Our codes are available at https://github.com/declare-lab/ferret.

Title: The Brittleness of AI-Generated Image Watermarking Techniques: Examining Their Robustness Against Visual Paraphrasing Attacks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10446
Summary: The rapid advancement of text-to-image generation systems, exemplified by models like Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, Imagen, and DALL-E, has heightened concerns about their potential misuse. In response, companies like Meta and Google have intensified their efforts to implement watermarking techniques on AI-generated images to curb the circulation of potentially misleading visuals. However, in this paper, we argue that current image watermarking methods are fragile and susceptible to being circumvented through visual paraphrase attacks. The proposed visual paraphraser operates in two steps. First, it generates a caption for the given image using KOSMOS-2, one of the latest state-of-the-art image captioning systems. Second, it passes both the original image and the generated caption to an image-to-image diffusion system. During the denoising step of the diffusion pipeline, the system generates a visually similar image that is guided by the text caption. The resulting image is a visual paraphrase and is free of any watermarks. Our empirical findings demonstrate that visual paraphrase attacks can effectively remove watermarks from images. This paper provides a critical assessment, empirically revealing the vulnerability of existing watermarking techniques to visual paraphrase attacks. While we do not propose solutions to this issue, this paper serves as a call to action for the scientific community to prioritize the development of more robust watermarking techniques. Our first-of-its-kind visual paraphrase dataset and accompanying code are publicly available.

Title: TableBench: A Comprehensive and Complex Benchmark for Table Question Answering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09174
Summary: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have markedly enhanced the interpretation and processing of tabular data, introducing previously unimaginable capabilities. Despite these achievements, LLMs still encounter significant challenges when applied in industrial scenarios, particularly due to the increased complexity of reasoning required with real-world tabular data, underscoring a notable disparity between academic benchmarks and practical applications. To address this discrepancy, we conduct a detailed investigation into the application of tabular data in industrial scenarios and propose a comprehensive and complex benchmark TableBench, including 18 fields within four major categories of table question answering (TableQA) capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce TableLLM, trained on our meticulously constructed training set TableInstruct, achieving comparable performance with GPT-3.5. Massive experiments conducted on TableBench indicate that both open-source and proprietary LLMs still have significant room for improvement to meet real-world demands, where the most advanced model, GPT-4, achieves only a modest score compared to humans.

Title: Predicting Rewards Alongside Tokens: Non-disruptive Parameter Insertion for Efficient Inference Intervention in Large Language Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10764
Summary: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations such as generating unsafe responses, unreliable reasoning, etc. Existing inference intervention approaches attempt to mitigate these issues by finetuning additional models to produce calibration signals (such as rewards) that guide the LLM's decoding process. However, this solution introduces substantial time and space overhead due to the separate models required. This work proposes Non-disruptive parameters insertion (Otter), inserting extra parameters into the transformer architecture to predict calibration signals along with the original LLM output. Otter offers state-of-the-art performance on multiple demanding tasks while saving up to 86.5\% extra space and 98.5\% extra time. Furthermore, Otter seamlessly integrates with existing inference engines, requiring only a one-line code change, and the original model response remains accessible after the parameter insertion. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/chenhan97/Otter

Title: RP1M: A Large-Scale Motion Dataset for Piano Playing with Bi-Manual Dexterous Robot Hands
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11048
Summary: It has been a long-standing research goal to endow robot hands with human-level dexterity. Bi-manual robot piano playing constitutes a task that combines challenges from dynamic tasks, such as generating fast while precise motions, with slower but contact-rich manipulation problems. Although reinforcement learning based approaches have shown promising results in single-task performance, these methods struggle in a multi-song setting. Our work aims to close this gap and, thereby, enable imitation learning approaches for robot piano playing at scale. To this end, we introduce the Robot Piano 1 Million (RP1M) dataset, containing bi-manual robot piano playing motion data of more than one million trajectories. We formulate finger placements as an optimal transport problem, thus, enabling automatic annotation of vast amounts of unlabeled songs. Benchmarking existing imitation learning approaches shows that such approaches reach state-of-the-art robot piano playing performance by leveraging RP1M.

Title: ShapeSplat: A Large-scale Dataset of Gaussian Splats and Their Self-Supervised Pretraining
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10906
Summary: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become the de facto method of 3D representation in many vision tasks. This calls for the 3D understanding directly in this representation space. To facilitate the research in this direction, we first build a large-scale dataset of 3DGS using the commonly used ShapeNet and ModelNet datasets. Our dataset ShapeSplat consists of 65K objects from 87 unique categories, whose labels are in accordance with the respective datasets. The creation of this dataset utilized the compute equivalent of 2 GPU years on a TITAN XP GPU.   We utilize our dataset for unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning for classification and segmentation tasks. To this end, we introduce \textit{Gaussian-MAE}, which highlights the unique benefits of representation learning from Gaussian parameters. Through exhaustive experiments, we provide several valuable insights. In particular, we show that (1) the distribution of the optimized GS centroids significantly differs from the uniformly sampled point cloud (used for initialization) counterpart; (2) this change in distribution results in degradation in classification but improvement in segmentation tasks when using only the centroids; (3) to leverage additional Gaussian parameters, we propose Gaussian feature grouping in a normalized feature space, along with splats pooling layer, offering a tailored solution to effectively group and embed similar Gaussians, which leads to notable improvement in finetuning tasks.

Title: MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context Generation with Speculative Decoding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11049
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency without sacrificing performance but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy speculative decoding more effectively for high throughput inference. Then, it leverages draft models with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck that scales with both sequence length and batch size.

Title: To Code, or Not To Code? Exploring Impact of Code in Pre-training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10914
Summary: Including code in the pre-training data mixture, even for models not specifically designed for code, has become a common practice in LLMs pre-training. While there has been anecdotal consensus among practitioners that code data plays a vital role in general LLMs' performance, there is only limited work analyzing the precise impact of code on non-code tasks. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of code data on general performance. We ask "what is the impact of code data used in pre-training on a large variety of downstream tasks beyond code generation". We conduct extensive ablations and evaluate across a broad range of natural language reasoning tasks, world knowledge tasks, code benchmarks, and LLM-as-a-judge win-rates for models with sizes ranging from 470M to 2.8B parameters. Across settings, we find a consistent results that code is a critical building block for generalization far beyond coding tasks and improvements to code quality have an outsized impact across all tasks. In particular, compared to text-only pre-training, the addition of code results in up to relative increase of 8.2% in natural language (NL) reasoning, 4.2% in world knowledge, 6.6% improvement in generative win-rates, and a 12x boost in code performance respectively. Our work suggests investments in code quality and preserving code during pre-training have positive impacts.

Title: Transfusion: Predict the Next Token and Diffuse Images with One Multi-Modal Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11039
Summary: We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer over mixed-modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds.

Title: Audio Match Cutting: Finding and Creating Matching Audio Transitions in Movies and Videos
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10998
Summary: A "match cut" is a common video editing technique where a pair of shots that have a similar composition transition fluidly from one to another. Although match cuts are often visual, certain match cuts involve the fluid transition of audio, where sounds from different sources merge into one indistinguishable transition between two shots. In this paper, we explore the ability to automatically find and create "audio match cuts" within videos and movies. We create a self-supervised audio representation for audio match cutting and develop a coarse-to-fine audio match pipeline that recommends matching shots and creates the blended audio. We further annotate a dataset for the proposed audio match cut task and compare the ability of multiple audio representations to find audio match cut candidates. Finally, we evaluate multiple methods to blend two matching audio candidates with the goal of creating a smooth transition.

Title: MambaEVT: Event Stream based Visual Object Tracking using State Space Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10487
Summary: Event camera-based visual tracking has drawn more and more attention in recent years due to the unique imaging principle and advantages of low energy consumption, high dynamic range, and dense temporal resolution. Current event-based tracking algorithms are gradually hitting their performance bottlenecks, due to the utilization of vision Transformer and the static template for target object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel Mamba-based visual tracking framework that adopts the state space model with linear complexity as a backbone network. The search regions and target template are fed into the vision Mamba network for simultaneous feature extraction and interaction. The output tokens of search regions will be fed into the tracking head for target localization. More importantly, we consider introducing a dynamic template update strategy into the tracking framework using the Memory Mamba network. By considering the diversity of samples in the target template library and making appropriate adjustments to the template memory module, a more effective dynamic template can be integrated. The effective combination of dynamic and static templates allows our Mamba-based tracking algorithm to achieve a good balance between accuracy and computational cost on multiple large-scale datasets, including EventVOT, VisEvent, and FE240hz. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/MambaEVT

Title: MegaFusion: Extend Diffusion Models towards Higher-resolution Image Generation without Further Tuning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11001
Summary: Diffusion models have emerged as frontrunners in text-to-image generation for their impressive capabilities. Nonetheless, their fixed image resolution during training often leads to challenges in high-resolution image generation, such as semantic inaccuracies and object replication. This paper introduces MegaFusion, a novel approach that extends existing diffusion-based text-to-image generation models towards efficient higher-resolution generation without additional fine-tuning or extra adaptation. Specifically, we employ an innovative truncate and relay strategy to bridge the denoising processes across different resolutions, allowing for high-resolution image generation in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, by integrating dilated convolutions and noise re-scheduling, we further adapt the model's priors for higher resolution. The versatility and efficacy of MegaFusion make it universally applicable to both latent-space and pixel-space diffusion models, along with other derivative models. Extensive experiments confirm that MegaFusion significantly boosts the capability of existing models to produce images of megapixels and various aspect ratios, while only requiring about 40% of the original computational cost.

Title: ShortCircuit: AlphaZero-Driven Circuit Design
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09858
Summary: Chip design relies heavily on generating Boolean circuits, such as AND-Inverter Graphs (AIGs), from functional descriptions like truth tables. While recent advances in deep learning have aimed to accelerate circuit design, these efforts have mostly focused on tasks other than synthesis, and traditional heuristic methods have plateaued. In this paper, we introduce ShortCircuit, a novel transformer-based architecture that leverages the structural properties of AIGs and performs efficient space exploration. Contrary to prior approaches attempting end-to-end generation of logic circuits using deep networks, ShortCircuit employs a two-phase process combining supervised with reinforcement learning to enhance generalization to unseen truth tables. We also propose an AlphaZero variant to handle the double exponentially large state space and the sparsity of the rewards, enabling the discovery of near-optimal designs. To evaluate the generative performance of our trained model , we extract 500 truth tables from a benchmark set of 20 real-world circuits. ShortCircuit successfully generates AIGs for 84.6% of the 8-input test truth tables, and outperforms the state-of-the-art logic synthesis tool, ABC, by 14.61% in terms of circuits size.

Title: SpaRP: Fast 3D Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation from Sparse Views
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10195
Summary: Open-world 3D generation has recently attracted considerable attention. While many single-image-to-3D methods have yielded visually appealing outcomes, they often lack sufficient controllability and tend to produce hallucinated regions that may not align with users' expectations. In this paper, we explore an important scenario in which the input consists of one or a few unposed 2D images of a single object, with little or no overlap. We propose a novel method, SpaRP, to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate the relative camera poses for these sparse-view images. SpaRP distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models and finetunes them to implicitly deduce the 3D spatial relationships between the sparse views. The diffusion model is trained to jointly predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-view images of the object under known poses, integrating all information from the input sparse views. These predictions are then leveraged to accomplish 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, and the reconstructed 3D model can be used to further refine the camera poses of input views. Through extensive experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and pose prediction accuracy but also exhibits strong efficiency. It requires only about 20 seconds to produce a textured mesh and camera poses for the input views. Project page: https://chaoxu.xyz/sparp.

Title: TraDiffusion: Trajectory-Based Training-Free Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09739
Summary: In this work, we propose a training-free, trajectory-based controllable T2I approach, termed TraDiffusion. This novel method allows users to effortlessly guide image generation via mouse trajectories. To achieve precise control, we design a distance awareness energy function to effectively guide latent variables, ensuring that the focus of generation is within the areas defined by the trajectory. The energy function encompasses a control function to draw the generation closer to the specified trajectory and a movement function to diminish activity in areas distant from the trajectory. Through extensive experiments and qualitative assessments on the COCO dataset, the results reveal that TraDiffusion facilitates simpler, more natural image control. Moreover, it showcases the ability to manipulate salient regions, attributes, and relationships within the generated images, alongside visual input based on arbitrary or enhanced trajectories.

Title: Photorealistic Object Insertion with Diffusion-Guided Inverse Rendering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09702
Summary: The correct insertion of virtual objects in images of real-world scenes requires a deep understanding of the scene's lighting, geometry and materials, as well as the image formation process. While recent large-scale diffusion models have shown strong generative and inpainting capabilities, we find that current models do not sufficiently "understand" the scene shown in a single picture to generate consistent lighting effects (shadows, bright reflections, etc.) while preserving the identity and details of the composited object. We propose using a personalized large diffusion model as guidance to a physically based inverse rendering process. Our method recovers scene lighting and tone-mapping parameters, allowing the photorealistic composition of arbitrary virtual objects in single frames or videos of indoor or outdoor scenes. Our physically based pipeline further enables automatic materials and tone-mapping refinement.

Title: Segment Anything with Multiple Modalities
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09085
Summary: Robust and accurate segmentation of scenes has become one core functionality in various visual recognition and navigation tasks. This has inspired the recent development of Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model for general mask segmentation. However, SAM is largely tailored for single-modal RGB images, limiting its applicability to multi-modal data captured with widely-adopted sensor suites, such as LiDAR plus RGB, depth plus RGB, thermal plus RGB, etc. We develop MM-SAM, an extension and expansion of SAM that supports cross-modal and multi-modal processing for robust and enhanced segmentation with different sensor suites. MM-SAM features two key designs, namely, unsupervised cross-modal transfer and weakly-supervised multi-modal fusion, enabling label-efficient and parameter-efficient adaptation toward various sensor modalities. It addresses three main challenges: 1) adaptation toward diverse non-RGB sensors for single-modal processing, 2) synergistic processing of multi-modal data via sensor fusion, and 3) mask-free training for different downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that MM-SAM consistently outperforms SAM by large margins, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various sensors and data modalities.

Title: Authorship Attribution in the Era of LLMs: Problems, Methodologies, and Challenges
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08946
Summary: Accurate attribution of authorship is crucial for maintaining the integrity of digital content, improving forensic investigations, and mitigating the risks of misinformation and plagiarism. Addressing the imperative need for proper authorship attribution is essential to uphold the credibility and accountability of authentic authorship. The rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have blurred the lines between human and machine authorship, posing significant challenges for traditional methods. We presents a comprehensive literature review that examines the latest research on authorship attribution in the era of LLMs. This survey systematically explores the landscape of this field by categorizing four representative problems: (1) Human-written Text Attribution; (2) LLM-generated Text Detection; (3) LLM-generated Text Attribution; and (4) Human-LLM Co-authored Text Attribution. We also discuss the challenges related to ensuring the generalization and explainability of authorship attribution methods. Generalization requires the ability to generalize across various domains, while explainability emphasizes providing transparent and understandable insights into the decisions made by these models. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing methods and benchmarks, we identify key open problems and future research directions in this field. This literature review serves a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field. Additional resources and a curated list of papers are available and regularly updated at https://llm-authorship.github.io

Title: Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risk of Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08926
Summary: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have the potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and other researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute bash commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks, which break down a task into intermediary steps for more gradated evaluation; we add subtasks for 17 of the 40 tasks. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 7 models: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. Without guidance, we find that agents are able to solve only the easiest complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o having the highest success rates. Finally, subtasks provide more signal for measuring performance compared to unguided runs, with models achieving a 3.2\% higher success rate on complete tasks with subtask-guidance than without subtask-guidance. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io

Title: LongVILA: Scaling Long-Context Visual Language Models for Long Videos
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10188
Summary: Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context vision-language models, including system, model training, and dataset development. On the system side, we introduce the first Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that enables long-context training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs. MM-SP is also efficient, being 2.1x - 5.7x faster than Ring-Style Sequence Parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron-LM in text-only settings. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers. For model training, we propose a five-stage pipeline comprising alignment, pre-training, context extension, and long-short joint supervised fine-tuning. Regarding datasets, we meticulously construct large-scale visual language pre-training datasets and long video instruction-following datasets to support our multi-stage training process. The full-stack solution extends the feasible frame number of VILA by a factor of 128 (from 8 to 1024 frames) and improves long video captioning score from 2.00 to 3.26 (1.6x), achieving 99.5% accuracy in 1400-frames video (274k context length) needle in a haystack. LongVILA-8B also demonstrates a consistent improvement in performance on long videos within the VideoMME benchmark as the video frames increase.

Title: Factorized-Dreamer: Training A High-Quality Video Generator with Limited and Low-Quality Data
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10119
Summary: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has gained significant attention due to its wide applications to video generation, editing, enhancement and translation, \etc. However, high-quality (HQ) video synthesis is extremely challenging because of the diverse and complex motions existed in real world. Most existing works struggle to address this problem by collecting large-scale HQ videos, which are inaccessible to the community. In this work, we show that publicly available limited and low-quality (LQ) data are sufficient to train a HQ video generator without recaptioning or finetuning. We factorize the whole T2V generation process into two steps: generating an image conditioned on a highly descriptive caption, and synthesizing the video conditioned on the generated image and a concise caption of motion details. Specifically, we present Factorized-Dreamer, a factorized spatiotemporal framework with several critical designs for T2V generation, including an adapter to combine text and image embeddings, a pixel-aware cross attention module to capture pixel-level image information, a T5 text encoder to better understand motion description, and a PredictNet to supervise optical flows. We further present a noise schedule, which plays a key role in ensuring the quality and stability of video generation. Our model lowers the requirements in detailed captions and HQ videos, and can be directly trained on limited LQ datasets with noisy and brief captions such as WebVid-10M, largely alleviating the cost to collect large-scale HQ video-text pairs. Extensive experiments in a variety of T2V and image-to-video generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Factorized-Dreamer. Our source codes are available at https://github.com/yangxy/Factorized-Dreamer/.

Title: MeshFormer: High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10198
Summary: Open-world 3D reconstruction models have recently garnered significant attention. However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. Project page: https://meshformer3d.github.io

Title: NeuFlow v2: High-Efficiency Optical Flow Estimation on Edge Devices
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10161
Summary: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is crucial for various real-world applications. While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with significant computational costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow method that balances high accuracy with reduced computational demands. Building upon NeuFlow v1, we introduce new components including a much more light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module. Both these modules help in keeping the computational demands light while providing close to state of the art accuracy. Compares to other state of the art methods, our model achieves a 10x-70x speedup while maintaining comparable performance on both synthetic and real-world data. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.

Title: Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Human-inspired Learning Strategies in Medical Question Answering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07888
Summary: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) incurs substantial data-related costs, motivating the development of data-efficient training methods through optimised data ordering and selection. Human-inspired learning strategies, such as curriculum learning, offer possibilities for efficient training by organising data according to common human learning practices. Despite evidence that fine-tuning with curriculum learning improves the performance of LLMs for natural language understanding tasks, its effectiveness is typically assessed using a single model. In this work, we extend previous research by evaluating both curriculum-based and non-curriculum-based learning strategies across multiple LLMs, using human-defined and automated data labels for medical question answering. Our results indicate a moderate impact of using human-inspired learning strategies for fine-tuning LLMs, with maximum accuracy gains of 1.77% per model and 1.81% per dataset. Crucially, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of these strategies varies significantly across different model-dataset combinations, emphasising that the benefits of a specific human-inspired strategy for fine-tuning LLMs do not generalise. Additionally, we find evidence that curriculum learning using LLM-defined question difficulty outperforms human-defined difficulty, highlighting the potential of using model-generated measures for optimal curriculum design.

Title: Surgical SAM 2: Real-time Segment Anything in Surgical Video by Efficient Frame Pruning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07931
Summary: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM-2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM-2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM-2 achieves a 3times FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM-2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a feasible reality.

Title: xGen-MM (BLIP-3): A Family of Open Large Multimodal Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08872

In addition, we introduce a safety-tuned model with DPO, aiming to mitigate harmful behaviors such as hallucinations and improve safety. We open-source our models, curated large-scale datasets, and our fine-tuning codebase to facilitate further advancements in LMM research. Associated resources will be available on our project page above.

Title: D5RL: Diverse Datasets for Data-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08441
Summary: Offline reinforcement learning algorithms hold the promise of enabling data-driven RL methods that do not require costly or dangerous real-world exploration and benefit from large pre-collected datasets. This in turn can facilitate real-world applications, as well as a more standardized approach to RL research. Furthermore, offline RL methods can provide effective initializations for online finetuning to overcome challenges with exploration. However, evaluating progress on offline RL algorithms requires effective and challenging benchmarks that capture properties of real-world tasks, provide a range of task difficulties, and cover a range of challenges both in terms of the parameters of the domain (e.g., length of the horizon, sparsity of rewards) and the parameters of the data (e.g., narrow demonstration data or broad exploratory data). While considerable progress in offline RL in recent years has been enabled by simpler benchmark tasks, the most widely used datasets are increasingly saturating in performance and may fail to reflect properties of realistic tasks. We propose a new benchmark for offline RL that focuses on realistic simulations of robotic manipulation and locomotion environments, based on models of real-world robotic systems, and comprising a variety of data sources, including scripted data, play-style data collected by human teleoperators, and other data sources. Our proposed benchmark covers state-based and image-based domains, and supports both offline RL and online fine-tuning evaluation, with some of the tasks specifically designed to require both pre-training and fine-tuning. We hope that our proposed benchmark will facilitate further progress on both offline RL and fine-tuning algorithms.

Title: Automated Design of Agentic Systems
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08435
Summary: Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. We formulate a new research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, control flows, and combinations thereof. We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality. Provided we develop it safely, our work illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity.

Title: TurboEdit: Instant text-based image editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08332
Summary: We address the challenges of precise image inversion and disentangled image editing in the context of few-step diffusion models. We introduce an encoder based iterative inversion technique. The inversion network is conditioned on the input image and the reconstructed image from the previous step, allowing for correction of the next reconstruction towards the input image. We demonstrate that disentangled controls can be easily achieved in the few-step diffusion model by conditioning on an (automatically generated) detailed text prompt. To manipulate the inverted image, we freeze the noise maps and modify one attribute in the text prompt (either manually or via instruction based editing driven by an LLM), resulting in the generation of a new image similar to the input image with only one attribute changed. It can further control the editing strength and accept instructive text prompt. Our approach facilitates realistic text-guided image edits in real-time, requiring only 8 number of functional evaluations (NFEs) in inversion (one-time cost) and 4 NFEs per edit. Our method is not only fast, but also significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multi-step diffusion editing techniques.

Title: JPEG-LM: LLMs as Image Generators with Canonical Codec Representations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08459
Summary: Recent work in image and video generation has been adopting the autoregressive LLM architecture due to its generality and potentially easy integration into multi-modal systems. The crux of applying autoregressive training in language generation to visual generation is discretization -- representing continuous data like images and videos as discrete tokens. Common methods of discretizing images and videos include modeling raw pixel values, which are prohibitively lengthy, or vector quantization, which requires convoluted pre-hoc training. In this work, we propose to directly model images and videos as compressed files saved on computers via canonical codecs (e.g., JPEG, AVC/H.264). Using the default Llama architecture without any vision-specific modifications, we pretrain JPEG-LM from scratch to generate images (and AVC-LM to generate videos as a proof of concept), by directly outputting compressed file bytes in JPEG and AVC formats. Evaluation of image generation shows that this simple and straightforward approach is more effective than pixel-based modeling and sophisticated vector quantization baselines (on which our method yields a 31% reduction in FID). Our analysis shows that JPEG-LM has an especial advantage over vector quantization models in generating long-tail visual elements. Overall, we show that using canonical codec representations can help lower the barriers between language generation and visual generation, facilitating future research on multi-modal language/image/video LLMs.

Title: The ShareLM Collection and Plugin: Contributing Human-Model Chats for the Benefit of the Community
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08291
Summary: Human-model conversations provide a window into users' real-world scenarios, behavior, and needs, and thus are a valuable resource for model development and research. While for-profit companies collect user data through the APIs of their models, using it internally to improve their own models, the open source and research community lags behind.   We introduce the ShareLM collection, a unified set of human conversations with large language models, and its accompanying plugin, a Web extension for voluntarily contributing user-model conversations. Where few platforms share their chats, the ShareLM plugin adds this functionality, thus, allowing users to share conversations from most platforms. The plugin allows the user to rate their conversations, both at the conversation and the response levels, and delete conversations they prefer to keep private before they ever leave the user's local storage. We release the plugin conversations as part of the ShareLM collection, and call for more community effort in the field of open human-model data.   The code, plugin, and data are available.

Title: FuseChat: Knowledge Fusion of Chat Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07990
Summary: While training large language models (LLMs) from scratch can indeed lead to models with distinct capabilities and strengths, it incurs substantial costs and may lead to redundancy in competencies. Knowledge fusion aims to integrate existing LLMs of diverse architectures and capabilities into a more potent LLM through lightweight continual training, thereby reducing the need for costly LLM development. In this work, we propose a new framework for the knowledge fusion of chat LLMs through two main stages, resulting in FuseChat. Firstly, we conduct pairwise knowledge fusion on source chat LLMs of varying structures and scales to create multiple target LLMs with identical structure and size via lightweight fine-tuning. During this process, a statistics-based token alignment approach is introduced as the cornerstone for fusing LLMs with different structures. Secondly, we merge these target LLMs within the parameter space, where we propose a novel method for determining the merging coefficients based on the magnitude of parameter updates before and after fine-tuning. We implement and validate FuseChat using six prominent chat LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, including OpenChat-3.5-7B, Starling-LM-7B-alpha, NH2-SOLAR-10.7B, InternLM2-Chat-20B, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, and Qwen-1.5-Chat-72B. Experimental results on two instruction-following benchmarks, AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench, demonstrate the superiority of FuseChat-7B over baselines of various sizes. Our model is even comparable to the larger Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct and approaches GPT-3.5-Turbo-1106 on MT-Bench. Our code, model weights, and data are public at https://github.com/fanqiwan/FuseAI.

Title: I-SHEEP: Self-Alignment of LLM from Scratch through an Iterative Self-Enhancement Paradigm
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08072
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements, however, the common learning paradigm treats LLMs as passive information repositories, neglecting their potential for active learning and alignment. Some approaches train LLMs using their own generated synthetic data, exploring the possibility of active alignment. However, there is still a huge gap between these one-time alignment methods and the continuous automatic alignment of humans. In this paper, we introduce I-SHEEP, an Iterative Self-EnHancEmEnt Paradigm.This human-like paradigm enables LLMs to continuously self-align from scratch with nothing. Compared to the one-time alignment method Dromedary sun2023principledriven, which refers to the first iteration in this paper, I-SHEEP can significantly enhance capacities on both Qwen and Llama models. I-SHEEP achieves a maximum relative improvement of 78.2\% in the Alpaca Eval, 24.0\% in the MT Bench, and an absolute increase of 8.88\% in the IFEval accuracy over subsequent iterations in Qwen-1.5 72B model. Additionally, I-SHEEP surpasses the base model in various standard benchmark generation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 24.77\% in code generation tasks, 12.04\% in TrivialQA, and 20.29\% in SQuAD. We also provide new insights based on the experiment results. Our codes, datasets, and models are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/I-SHEEP.

Title: BAM! Just Like That: Simple and Efficient Parameter Upcycling for Mixture of Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.08274
Summary: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework has become a popular architecture for large language models due to its superior performance over dense models. However, training MoEs from scratch in a large-scale regime is prohibitively expensive. Existing methods mitigate this by pre-training multiple dense expert models independently and using them to initialize an MoE. This is done by using experts' feed-forward network (FFN) to initialize the MoE's experts while merging other parameters. However, this method limits the reuse of dense model parameters to only the FFN layers, thereby constraining the advantages when "upcycling" these models into MoEs. We propose BAM (Branch-Attend-Mix), a simple yet effective method that addresses this shortcoming. BAM makes full use of specialized dense models by not only using their FFN to initialize the MoE layers but also leveraging experts' attention parameters fully by initializing them into a soft-variant of Mixture of Attention (MoA) layers. We explore two methods for upcycling attention parameters: 1) initializing separate attention experts from dense models including all attention parameters for the best model performance; and 2) sharing key and value parameters across all experts to facilitate for better inference efficiency. To further improve efficiency, we adopt a parallel attention transformer architecture to MoEs, which allows the attention experts and FFN experts to be computed concurrently. Our experiments on seed models ranging from 590 million to 2 billion parameters demonstrate that BAM surpasses baselines in both perplexity and downstream task performance, within the same computational and data constraints.

Title: Training Language Models on the Knowledge Graph: Insights on Hallucinations and Their Detectability
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07852
Summary: While many capabilities of language models (LMs) improve with increased training budget, the influence of scale on hallucinations is not yet fully understood. Hallucinations come in many forms, and there is no universally accepted definition. We thus focus on studying only those hallucinations where a correct answer appears verbatim in the training set. To fully control the training data content, we construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. We find that for a fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on leq5% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal. Given this costliness, we study how hallucination detectors depend on scale. While we see detector size improves performance on fixed LM's outputs, we find an inverse relationship between the scale of the LM and the detectability of its hallucinations.
