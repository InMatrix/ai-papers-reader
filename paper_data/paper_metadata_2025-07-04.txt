Title: Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model
  Evaluation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.02856
Summary: Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate. However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading. Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern: the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer matching.

Title: Î¼^2Tokenizer: Differentiable Multi-Scale Multi-Modal Tokenizer for
  Radiology Report Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00316
Summary: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints, and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we propose mu^2LLM, a textbf{mu}ltiscale textbf{mu}ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The novel {mu}^2Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization (DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned mu^2LLMs on limited data for RRG tasks.

Title: ARIG: Autoregressive Interactive Head Generation for Real-time
  Conversations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00472
Summary: Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure, achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our model.

Title: MARVIS: Modality Adaptive Reasoning over VISualizations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01544
Summary: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision, audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model, achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or requiring any domain-specific training. We open source our code and datasets at https://github.com/penfever/marvis

Title: Locality-aware Parallel Decoding for Efficient Autoregressive Image
  Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01957
Summary: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2) Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256 to 20 (256times256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512times512 res.) without compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and achieving at least 3.4times lower latency than previous parallelized autoregressive models.

Title: STR-Match: Matching SpatioTemporal Relevance Score for Training-Free
  Video Editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22868
Summary: Previous text-guided video editing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistency, motion distortion, and-most notably-limited domain transformation. We attribute these limitations to insufficient modeling of spatiotemporal pixel relevance during the editing process. To address this, we propose STR-Match, a training-free video editing algorithm that produces visually appealing and spatiotemporally coherent videos through latent optimization guided by our novel STR score. The score captures spatiotemporal pixel relevance across adjacent frames by leveraging 2D spatial attention and 1D temporal modules in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models, without the overhead of computationally expensive 3D attention mechanisms. Integrated into a latent optimization framework with a latent mask, STR-Match generates temporally consistent and visually faithful videos, maintaining strong performance even under significant domain transformations while preserving key visual attributes of the source. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STR-Match consistently outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and spatiotemporal consistency.

Title: A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models: An Action Tokenization
  Perspective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01925
Summary: The remarkable advancements of vision and language foundation models in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation has sparked growing efforts to extend such intelligence to the physical world, fueling the flourishing of vision-language-action (VLA) models. Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain of action tokens that progressively encode more grounded and actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation, raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.

Title: FreeMorph: Tuning-Free Generalized Image Morphing with Diffusion Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01953
Summary: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

Title: LongAnimation: Long Animation Generation with Dynamic Global-Local
  Memory
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01945
Summary: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore, automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation. Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color consistency for open-domain animation colorization task.

Title: Kwai Keye-VL Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01949
Summary: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic, information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce Kwai Keye-VL, an 8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment, followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop and release the KC-MMBench, a new benchmark tailored for real-world short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Title: Depth Anything at Any Condition
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01634
Summary: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships, resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details. Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks, synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

Title: JAM-Flow: Joint Audio-Motion Synthesis with Flow Matching
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23552
Summary: The intrinsic link between facial motion and speech is often overlooked in generative modeling, where talking head synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) are typically addressed as separate tasks. This paper introduces JAM-Flow, a unified framework to simultaneously synthesize and condition on both facial motion and speech. Our approach leverages flow matching and a novel Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) architecture, integrating specialized Motion-DiT and Audio-DiT modules. These are coupled via selective joint attention layers and incorporate key architectural choices, such as temporally aligned positional embeddings and localized joint attention masking, to enable effective cross-modal interaction while preserving modality-specific strengths. Trained with an inpainting-style objective, JAM-Flow supports a wide array of conditioning inputs-including text, reference audio, and reference motion-facilitating tasks such as synchronized talking head generation from text, audio-driven animation, and much more, within a single, coherent model. JAM-Flow significantly advances multi-modal generative modeling by providing a practical solution for holistic audio-visual synthesis. project page: https://joonghyuk.com/jamflow-web

Title: Ella: Embodied Social Agents with Lifelong Memory
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24019
Summary: We introduce Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning within a community in a 3D open world, where agents accumulate experiences and acquire knowledge through everyday visual observations and social interactions. At the core of Ella's capabilities is a structured, long-term multimodal memory system that stores, updates, and retrieves information effectively. It consists of a name-centric semantic memory for organizing acquired knowledge and a spatiotemporal episodic memory for capturing multimodal experiences. By integrating this lifelong memory system with foundation models, Ella retrieves relevant information for decision-making, plans daily activities, builds social relationships, and evolves autonomously while coexisting with other intelligent beings in the open world. We conduct capability-oriented evaluations in a dynamic 3D open world where 15 agents engage in social activities for days and are assessed with a suite of unseen controlled evaluations. Experimental results show that Ella can influence, lead, and cooperate with other agents well to achieve goals, showcasing its ability to learn effectively through observation and social interaction. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of combining structured memory systems with foundation models for advancing embodied intelligence.

Title: MusiXQA: Advancing Visual Music Understanding in Multimodal Large
  Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23009
Summary: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable visual reasoning abilities in natural images, text-rich documents, and graphic designs. However, their ability to interpret music sheets remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce MusiXQA, the first comprehensive dataset for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in music sheet understanding. MusiXQA features high-quality synthetic music sheets generated via MusiXTeX, with structured annotations covering note pitch and duration, chords, clefs, key/time signatures, and text, enabling diverse visual QA tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we reveal significant limitations of current state-of-the-art MLLMs in this domain. Beyond benchmarking, we developed Phi-3-MusiX, an MLLM fine-tuned on our dataset, achieving significant performance gains over GPT-based methods. The proposed dataset and model establish a foundation for future advances in MLLMs for music sheet understanding. Code, data, and model will be released upon acceptance.

Title: FreNBRDF: A Frequency-Rectified Neural Material Representation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00476
Summary: Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering, bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs. While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.

Title: Mixture of Reasonings: Teach Large Language Models to Reason with
  Adaptive Strategies
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00606
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust reasoning across diverse tasks.

Title: Training for X-Ray Vision: Amodal Segmentation, Amodal Content
  Completion, and View-Invariant Object Representation from Multi-Camera Video
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00339
Summary: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video. MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking, and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth amodal content. The full dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Amar-S/MOVi-MC-AC ,

Title: Confident Splatting: Confidence-Based Compression of 3D Gaussian
  Splatting via Learnable Beta Distributions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22973
Summary: 3D Gaussian Splatting enables high-quality real-time rendering but often produces millions of splats, resulting in excessive storage and computational overhead. We propose a novel lossy compression method based on learnable confidence scores modeled as Beta distributions. Each splat's confidence is optimized through reconstruction-aware losses, enabling pruning of low-confidence splats while preserving visual fidelity. The proposed approach is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to any Gaussian Splatting variant. In addition, the average confidence values serve as a new metric to assess the quality of the scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable trade-offs between compression and fidelity compared to prior work. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/amirhossein-razlighi/Confident-Splatting

Title: IR3D-Bench: Evaluating Vision-Language Model Scene Understanding as
  Agentic Inverse Rendering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23329
Summary: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at descriptive tasks, but whether they truly understand scenes from visual observations remains uncertain. We introduce IR3D-Bench, a benchmark challenging VLMs to demonstrate understanding through active creation rather than passive recognition. Grounded in the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm, IR3D-Bench tasks Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) with actively using programming and rendering tools to recreate the underlying 3D structure of an input image, achieving agentic inverse rendering through tool use. This "understanding-by-creating" approach probes the tool-using generative capacity of VLAs, moving beyond the descriptive or conversational capacity measured by traditional scene understanding benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive suite of metrics to evaluate geometric accuracy, spatial relations, appearance attributes, and overall plausibility. Initial experiments on agentic inverse rendering powered by various state-of-the-art VLMs highlight current limitations, particularly in visual precision rather than basic tool usage. IR3D-Bench, including data and evaluation protocols, is released to facilitate systematic study and development of tool-using VLAs towards genuine scene understanding by creating.

Title: FreeLong++: Training-Free Long Video Generation via Multi-band
  SpectralFusion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00162
Summary: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows, an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this, FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale. By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

Title: Data Efficacy for Language Model Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21545
Summary: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly, various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection. Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM training.

Title: GLM-4.1V-Thinking: Towards Versatile Multimodal Reasoning with Scalable
  Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01006
Summary: We present GLM-4.1V-Thinking, a vision-language model (VLM) designed to advance general-purpose multimodal reasoning. In this report, we share our key findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential through large-scale pre-training, which arguably sets the upper bound for the final performance. Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Sampling (RLCS) then unlocks the full potential of the model, leading to comprehensive capability enhancement across a diverse range of tasks, including STEM problem solving, video understanding, content recognition, coding, grounding, GUI-based agents, and long document understanding, among others. To facilitate research in this field, we open-source GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking, which achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size. In a comprehensive evaluation across 28 public benchmarks, our model outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on nearly all tasks and achieves comparable or even superior performance on 18 benchmarks relative to the significantly larger Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Notably, GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking also demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT-4o on challenging tasks including long document understanding and STEM reasoning, further underscoring its strong capabilities. Code, models and more information are released at https://github.com/THUDM/GLM-4.1V-Thinking.

Title: Radial Attention: O(nlog n) Sparse Attention with Energy Decay for
  Long Video Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19852
Summary: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality video generation, but the additional temporal dimension significantly increases computational costs, making training and inference on long videos prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon we term Spatiotemporal Energy Decay in video diffusion models: post-softmax attention scores diminish as spatial and temporal distance between tokens increase, akin to the physical decay of signal or waves over space and time in nature. Motivated by this, we propose Radial Attention, a scalable sparse attention mechanism with O(n log n) complexity that translates energy decay into exponentially decaying compute density, which is significantly more efficient than standard O(n^2) dense attention and more expressive than linear attention. Specifically, Radial Attention employs a simple, static attention mask where each token attends to spatially nearby tokens, with the attention window size shrinking with temporal distance. Moreover, it allows pre-trained video diffusion models to extend their generation length with efficient LoRA-based fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that Radial Attention maintains video quality across Wan2.1-14B, HunyuanVideo, and Mochi 1, achieving up to a 1.9times speedup over the original dense attention. With minimal tuning, it enables video generation up to 4times longer while reducing training costs by up to 4.4times compared to direct fine-tuning and accelerating inference by up to 3.7times compared to dense attention inference.

Title: Peccavi: Visual Paraphrase Attack Safe and Distortion Free Image
  Watermarking Technique for AI-Generated Images
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22960
Summary: A report by the European Union Law Enforcement Agency predicts that by 2026, up to 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated, raising concerns among policymakers, who cautioned that "Generative AI could act as a force multiplier for political disinformation. The combined effect of generative text, images, videos, and audio may surpass the influence of any single modality." In response, California's Bill AB 3211 mandates the watermarking of AI-generated images, videos, and audio. However, concerns remain regarding the vulnerability of invisible watermarking techniques to tampering and the potential for malicious actors to bypass them entirely. Generative AI-powered de-watermarking attacks, especially the newly introduced visual paraphrase attack, have shown an ability to fully remove watermarks, resulting in a paraphrase of the original image. This paper introduces PECCAVI, the first visual paraphrase attack-safe and distortion-free image watermarking technique. In visual paraphrase attacks, an image is altered while preserving its core semantic regions, termed Non-Melting Points (NMPs). PECCAVI strategically embeds watermarks within these NMPs and employs multi-channel frequency domain watermarking. It also incorporates noisy burnishing to counter reverse-engineering efforts aimed at locating NMPs to disrupt the embedded watermark, thereby enhancing durability. PECCAVI is model-agnostic. All relevant resources and codes will be open-sourced.

Title: DiffuCoder: Understanding and Improving Masked Diffusion Models for Code
  Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20639
Summary: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are compelling alternatives to autoregressive (AR) models because their denoising models operate over the entire sequence. The global planning and iterative refinement features of dLLMs are particularly useful for code generation. However, current training and inference mechanisms for dLLMs in coding are still under-explored. To demystify the decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we systematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, DiffuCoder, on 130B tokens of code. Using this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how it differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their generation should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing the sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their generation order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts. For RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and maintain training efficiency, we propose coupled-GRPO, a novel sampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used in training. In our experiments, coupled-GRPO significantly improves DiffuCoder's performance on code generation benchmarks (+4.4\% on EvalPlus) and reduces reliance on AR causal during decoding. Our work provides deeper insight into the machinery of dLLM generation and offers an effective, diffusion-native RL training framework. https://github.com/apple/ml-diffucoder.

Title: SciArena: An Open Evaluation Platform for Foundation Models in
  Scientific Literature Tasks
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01001
Summary: We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks for scientific literature understanding and synthesis, SciArena engages the research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence, SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based on our collected preference data. The benchmark measures the accuracy of models in judging answer quality by comparing their pairwise assessments with human votes. Our experiments highlight the benchmark's challenges and emphasize the need for more reliable automated evaluation methods.

Title: Thinking Beyond Tokens: From Brain-Inspired Intelligence to Cognitive
  Foundations for Artificial General Intelligence and its Societal Impact
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00951
Summary: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5, DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models, and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies, including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular, interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning, and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

Title: MoCa: Modality-aware Continual Pre-training Makes Better Bidirectional
  Multimodal Embeddings
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23115
Summary: Multimodal embedding models, built upon causal Vision Language Models (VLMs), have shown promise in various tasks. However, current approaches face three key limitations: the use of causal attention in VLM backbones is suboptimal for embedding tasks; scalability issues due to reliance on high-quality labeled paired data for contrastive learning; and limited diversity in training objectives and data. To address these issues, we propose MoCa, a two-stage framework for transforming pre-trained VLMs into effective bidirectional multimodal embedding models. The first stage, Modality-aware Continual Pre-training, introduces a joint reconstruction objective that simultaneously denoises interleaved text and image inputs, enhancing bidirectional context-aware reasoning. The second stage, Heterogeneous Contrastive Fine-tuning, leverages diverse, semantically rich multimodal data beyond simple image-caption pairs to enhance generalization and alignment. Our method addresses the stated limitations by introducing bidirectional attention through continual pre-training, scaling effectively with massive unlabeled datasets via joint reconstruction objectives, and utilizing diverse multimodal data for enhanced representation robustness. Experiments demonstrate that MoCa consistently improves performance across MMEB and ViDoRe-v2 benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results, and exhibits strong scalability with both model size and training data on MMEB.

Title: HumanOmniV2: From Understanding to Omni-Modal Reasoning with Context
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21277
Summary: With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to deeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical capability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the challenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain largely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing multimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and shortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model misinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut problem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs, directly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information. To tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with a clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This global context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking key multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the accurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a context reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy rewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the LLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process successfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also introduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating models in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed method demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks compared to other open-source omni-modal models.

Title: Does Math Reasoning Improve General LLM Capabilities? Understanding
  Transferability of LLM Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.00432
Summary: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

Title: RExBench: Can coding agents autonomously implement AI research
  extensions?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22598
Summary: Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for performing sophisticated software engineering tasks autonomously. In addition, there has been progress towards developing agents that can perform parts of the research pipeline in machine learning and the natural sciences. We argue that research extension and its implementation is a critical capability for such systems, and introduce RExBench to support the evaluation of this capability. RExBench is a benchmark consisting of 12 realistic research experiment implementation tasks that aim to investigate research hypotheses that have not previously been implemented. Each task is set up as an extension to an existing research paper and codebase, accompanied by domain expert-written instructions. RExBench is robust to data contamination, and supports an automatic evaluation infrastructure that executes agent outputs to determine whether the success criteria are met. We use this benchmark to evaluate nine LLM agents implemented using three different frameworks: aider, Claude Code, and OpenHands. We find that all agents evaluated fail to autonomously implement the majority of the extensions. Although the success rate improves with additional human-written hints, the best performance under this setting remains below 40%. This indicates that current agents are still short of being able to handle realistic research extension tasks without substantial human guidance.

Title: Tower+: Bridging Generality and Translation Specialization in
  Multilingual LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17080
Summary: Fine-tuning pretrained LLMs has been shown to be an effective strategy for reaching state-of-the-art performance on specific tasks like machine translation. However, this process of adaptation often implies sacrificing general-purpose capabilities, such as conversational reasoning and instruction-following, hampering the utility of the system in real-world applications that require a mixture of skills. In this paper, we introduce Tower+, a suite of models designed to deliver strong performance across both translation and multilingual general-purpose text capabilities. We achieve a Pareto frontier between translation specialization and multilingual general-purpose capabilities by introducing a novel training recipe that builds on Tower (Alves et al., 2024), comprising continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, preference optimization, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. At each stage of training, we carefully generate and curate data to strengthen performance on translation as well as general-purpose tasks involving code generation, mathematics problem solving, and general instruction-following. We develop models at multiple scales: 2B, 9B, and 72B. Our smaller models often outperform larger general-purpose open-weight and proprietary LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o). Our largest model delivers best-in-class translation performance for high-resource languages and top results in multilingual Arena Hard evaluations and in IF-MT, a benchmark we introduce for evaluating both translation and instruction-following. Our findings highlight that it is possible to rival frontier models in general capabilities, while optimizing for specific business domains, such as translation and localization.

Title: MEMFOF: High-Resolution Training for Memory-Efficient Multi-Frame
  Optical Flow Estimation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23151
Summary: Recent advances in optical flow estimation have prioritized accuracy at the cost of growing GPU memory consumption, particularly for high-resolution (FullHD) inputs. We introduce MEMFOF, a memory-efficient multi-frame optical flow method that identifies a favorable trade-off between multi-frame estimation and GPU memory usage. Notably, MEMFOF requires only 2.09 GB of GPU memory at runtime for 1080p inputs, and 28.5 GB during training, which uniquely positions our method to be trained at native 1080p without the need for cropping or downsampling. We systematically revisit design choices from RAFT-like architectures, integrating reduced correlation volumes and high-resolution training protocols alongside multi-frame estimation, to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks while substantially reducing memory overhead. Our method outperforms more resource-intensive alternatives in both accuracy and runtime efficiency, validating its robustness for flow estimation at high resolutions. At the time of submission, our method ranks first on the Spring benchmark with a 1-pixel (1px) outlier rate of 3.289, leads Sintel (clean) with an endpoint error (EPE) of 0.963, and achieves the best Fl-all error on KITTI-2015 at 2.94%.

Title: Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for Tunable Metalens Photography
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22753
Summary: Metalenses offer significant potential for ultra-compact computational imaging but face challenges from complex optical degradation and computational restoration difficulties. Existing methods typically rely on precise optical calibration or massive paired datasets, which are non-trivial for real-world imaging systems. Furthermore, a lack of control over the inference process often results in undesirable hallucinated artifacts. We introduce Degradation-Modeled Multipath Diffusion for tunable metalens photography, leveraging powerful natural image priors from pretrained models instead of large datasets. Our framework uses positive, neutral, and negative-prompt paths to balance high-frequency detail generation, structural fidelity, and suppression of metalens-specific degradation, alongside pseudo data augmentation. A tunable decoder enables controlled trade-offs between fidelity and perceptual quality. Additionally, a spatially varying degradation-aware attention (SVDA) module adaptively models complex optical and sensor-induced degradation. Finally, we design and build a millimeter-scale MetaCamera for real-world validation. Extensive results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-fidelity and sharp image reconstruction. More materials: https://dmdiff.github.io/.

Title: Listener-Rewarded Thinking in VLMs for Image Preferences
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22832
Summary: Training robust and generalizable reward models for human visual preferences is essential for aligning text-to-image and text-to-video generative models with human intent. However, current reward models often fail to generalize, and supervised fine-tuning leads to memorization, demanding complex annotation pipelines. While reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), improves generalization, we uncover a key failure mode: a significant drop in reasoning accuracy occurs when a model's reasoning trace contradicts that of an independent, frozen vision-language model ("listener") evaluating the same output. To address this, we introduce a listener-augmented GRPO framework. Here, the listener re-evaluates the reasoner's chain-of-thought to provide a dense, calibrated confidence score, shaping the RL reward signal. This encourages the reasoner not only to answer correctly, but to produce explanations that are persuasive to an independent model. Our listener-shaped reward scheme achieves best accuracy on the ImageReward benchmark (67.4%), significantly improves out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on a large-scale human preference dataset (1.2M votes, up to +6% over naive reasoner), and reduces reasoning contradictions compared to strong GRPO and SFT baselines. These results demonstrate that listener-based rewards provide a scalable, data-efficient path to aligning vision-language models with nuanced human preferences. We will release our reasoning model here: https://huggingface.co/alexgambashidze/qwen2.5vl_image_preference_reasoner.

Title: RoboScape: Physics-informed Embodied World Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23135
Summary: World models have become indispensable tools for embodied intelligence, serving as powerful simulators capable of generating realistic robotic videos while addressing critical data scarcity challenges. However, current embodied world models exhibit limited physical awareness, particularly in modeling 3D geometry and motion dynamics, resulting in unrealistic video generation for contact-rich robotic scenarios. In this paper, we present RoboScape, a unified physics-informed world model that jointly learns RGB video generation and physics knowledge within an integrated framework. We introduce two key physics-informed joint training tasks: temporal depth prediction that enhances 3D geometric consistency in video rendering, and keypoint dynamics learning that implicitly encodes physical properties (e.g., object shape and material characteristics) while improving complex motion modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboScape generates videos with superior visual fidelity and physical plausibility across diverse robotic scenarios. We further validate its practical utility through downstream applications including robotic policy training with generated data and policy evaluation. Our work provides new insights for building efficient physics-informed world models to advance embodied intelligence research. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/RoboScape.

Title: MARBLE: A Hard Benchmark for Multimodal Spatial Reasoning and Planning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22992
Summary: The ability to process information from multiple modalities and to reason through it step-by-step remains a critical challenge in advancing artificial intelligence. However, existing reasoning benchmarks focus on text-only reasoning, or employ multimodal questions that can be answered by directly retrieving information from a non-text modality. Thus, complex reasoning remains poorly understood in multimodal domains. Here, we present MARBLE, a challenging multimodal reasoning benchmark that is designed to scrutinize multimodal language models (MLLMs) in their ability to carefully reason step-by-step through complex multimodal problems and environments. MARBLE is composed of two highly challenging tasks, M-Portal and M-Cube, that require the crafting and understanding of multistep plans under spatial, visual, and physical constraints. We find that current MLLMs perform poorly on MARBLE -- all the 12 advanced models obtain near-random performance on M-Portal and 0% accuracy on M-Cube. Only in simplified subtasks some models outperform the random baseline, indicating that complex reasoning is still a challenge for existing MLLMs. Moreover, we show that perception remains a bottleneck, where MLLMs occasionally fail to extract information from the visual inputs. By shedding a light on the limitations of MLLMs, we hope that MARBLE will spur the development of the next generation of models with the ability to reason and plan across many, multimodal reasoning steps.

Title: Ovis-U1 Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23044
Summary: In this report, we introduce Ovis-U1, a 3-billion-parameter unified model that integrates multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing capabilities. Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.

Title: UrbanLLaVA: A Multi-modal Large Language Model for Urban Intelligence
  with Spatial Reasoning and Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23219
Summary: Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the understanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data types and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them comprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we introduce UrbanLLaVA, a multi-modal large language model designed to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong performance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In UrbanLLaVA, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset encompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from location view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a multi-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement from domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and downstream performance of UrbanLLaVA across diverse urban tasks. Finally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the performance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results from three cities demonstrate that UrbanLLaVA outperforms open-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex cross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities. Source codes and data are openly accessible to the research community via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA.

Title: VOCABTRIM: Vocabulary Pruning for Efficient Speculative Decoding in LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22694
Summary: In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.

Title: ThinkSound: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
  Models for Audio Generation and Editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21448
Summary: While end-to-end video-to-audio generation has greatly improved, producing high-fidelity audio that authentically captures the nuances of visual content remains challenging. Like professionals in the creative industries, such generation requires sophisticated reasoning about items such as visual dynamics, acoustic environments, and temporal relationships. We present ThinkSound, a novel framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enable stepwise, interactive audio generation and editing for videos. Our approach decomposes the process into three complementary stages: foundational foley generation that creates semantically coherent soundscapes, interactive object-centric refinement through precise user interactions, and targeted editing guided by natural language instructions. At each stage, a multimodal large language model generates contextually aligned CoT reasoning that guides a unified audio foundation model. Furthermore, we introduce AudioCoT, a comprehensive dataset with structured reasoning annotations that establishes connections between visual content, textual descriptions, and sound synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that ThinkSound achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio generation across both audio metrics and CoT metrics and excels in out-of-distribution Movie Gen Audio benchmark. The demo page is available at https://ThinkSound-Project.github.io.

Title: SparseLoRA: Accelerating LLM Fine-Tuning with Contextual Sparsity
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.16500
Summary: Fine-tuning LLMs is both computationally and memory-intensive. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as QLoRA and DoRA, reduce the number of trainable parameters and lower memory usage, they do not decrease computational cost. In some cases, they may even slow down fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce SparseLoRA, a method that accelerates LLM fine-tuning through contextual sparsity. We propose a lightweight, training-free SVD sparsity estimator that dynamically selects a sparse subset of weights for loss and gradient computation. Also, we systematically analyze and address sensitivity across layers, tokens, and training steps. Our experimental results show that SparseLoRA reduces computational cost by up to 2.2 times and a measured speedup of up to 1.6 times while maintaining accuracy across various downstream tasks, including commonsense and arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and instruction following.

Title: Teaching a Language Model to Speak the Language of Tools
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23394
Summary: External tool integration through function-calling is essential for practical language model applications, yet most multilingual models lack reliable tool-use capabilities in non-English languages. Even state-of-the-art multilingual models struggle with determining when to use tools and generating the structured outputs required for function calls, often exhibiting language confusion when prompted in lower-resource languages. This work presents a methodology for adapting existing language models to enable robust tool use in any target language, using Bulgarian as a case study. The approach involves continued training of the BgGPT model series (2.6B, 9B, 27B parameters) on a novel bilingual dataset of 10,035 function-calling examples designed to support standardized protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol). The research introduces TUCAN (Tool-Using Capable Assistant Navigator), which achieves up to 28.75% improvement in function-calling accuracy over base models while preserving core language understanding, as verified on established Bulgarian benchmarks. Beyond accuracy gains, TUCAN models demonstrate production-ready response formatting with clean, parsable function calls, contrasting with the verbose and inconsistent outputs of base models. The models, evaluation framework, and dataset are released to enable replication for other languages. This work demonstrates a practical approach for extending tool-augmented capabilities beyond English-centric systems.

Title: SPIRAL: Self-Play on Zero-Sum Games Incentivizes Reasoning via
  Multi-Agent Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24119
Summary: Recent advances in reinforcement learning have shown that language models can develop sophisticated reasoning through training on tasks with verifiable rewards, but these approaches depend on human-curated problem-answer pairs and domain-specific reward engineering. We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.

Title: Evolving Prompts In-Context: An Open-ended, Self-replicating Perspective
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17930
Summary: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish" can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the "gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more effective LLM prompting.

Title: Consistent Time-of-Flight Depth Denoising via Graph-Informed Geometric
  Attention
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23542
Summary: Depth images captured by Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors are prone to noise, requiring denoising for reliable downstream applications. Previous works either focus on single-frame processing, or perform multi-frame processing without considering depth variations at corresponding pixels across frames, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistency and spatial ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a novel ToF depth denoising network leveraging motion-invariant graph fusion to simultaneously enhance temporal stability and spatial sharpness. Specifically, despite depth shifts across frames, graph structures exhibit temporal self-similarity, enabling cross-frame geometric attention for graph fusion. Then, by incorporating an image smoothness prior on the fused graph and data fidelity term derived from ToF noise distribution, we formulate a maximum a posterior problem for ToF denoising. Finally, the solution is unrolled into iterative filters whose weights are adaptively learned from the graph-informed geometric attention, producing a high-performance yet interpretable network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and consistency on synthetic DVToF dataset and exhibits robust generalization on the real Kinectv2 dataset. Source code will be released at https://github.com/davidweidawang/GIGA-ToF{https://github.com/davidweidawang/GIGA-ToF}.

Title: Calligrapher: Freestyle Text Image Customization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.24123
Summary: We introduce Calligrapher, a novel diffusion-based framework that innovatively integrates advanced text customization with artistic typography for digital calligraphy and design applications. Addressing the challenges of precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography, Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.

Title: VMoBA: Mixture-of-Block Attention for Video Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23858
Summary: The quadratic complexity of full attention mechanisms poses a significant bottleneck for Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) aiming to generate long-duration, high-resolution videos. While various sparse attention methods have been proposed, many are designed as training-free inference accelerators or do not optimally capture the unique spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in video data when trained natively. This paper introduces Video Mixture of Block Attention (VMoBA), a novel sparse attention mechanism specifically adapted for VDMs. Motivated by an in-depth analysis of attention patterns within pre-trained video transformers, which revealed strong spatio-temporal locality, varying query importance, and head-specific concentration levels, VMoBA enhances the original MoBA framework with three key modifications: (1) a layer-wise recurrent block partition scheme (1D-2D-3D) to dynamically adapt to diverse spatio-temporal attention patterns and improve efficiency; (2) global block selection to prioritize the most salient query-key block interactions across an entire attention head; and (3) threshold-based block selection to dynamically determine the number of attended blocks based on their cumulative similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMoBA significantly accelerates the training of VDMs on longer sequences, achieving 2.92x FLOPs and 1.48x latency speedup, while attaining comparable or even superior generation quality to full attention. Furthermore, VMoBA exhibits competitive performance in training-free inference, offering 2.40x FLOPs and 1.35x latency speedup for high-res video generation.

Title: Aha Moment Revisited: Are VLMs Truly Capable of Self Verification in
  Inference-time Scaling?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17417
Summary: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs), particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

Title: Jan-nano Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22760
Summary: Most language models face a fundamental tradeoff where powerful capabilities require substantial computational resources. We shatter this constraint with Jan-nano, a 4B parameter language model that redefines efficiency through radical specialization: instead of trying to know everything, it masters the art of finding anything instantly. Fine-tuned from Qwen3-4B using our novel multi-stage RLVR system that completely eliminates reliance on next token prediction training (SFT), Jan-nano achieves 83.2% on SimpleQA benchmark with MCP integration while running on consumer hardware. With 128K context length, Jan-nano proves that intelligence isn't about scale, it's about strategy.
