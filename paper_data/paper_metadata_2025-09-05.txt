Title: Beyond Correctness: Harmonizing Process and Outcome Rewards through RL
  Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03403
Summary: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.   To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function (arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only consistently improves the final accuracy over 4% compared to the blending approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Title: Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in
  Robots
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02530
Summary: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects. Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Title: SATQuest: A Verifier for Logical Reasoning Evaluation and Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning of LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00930
Summary: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional, systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Title: Planning with Reasoning using Vision Language World Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02722
Summary: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Title: LMEnt: A Suite for Analyzing Knowledge in Language Models from
  Pretraining Data to Representations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03405
Summary: Language models (LMs) increasingly drive real-world applications that require world knowledge. However, the internal processes through which models turn data into representations of knowledge and beliefs about the world, are poorly understood. Insights into these processes could pave the way for developing LMs with knowledge representations that are more consistent, robust, and complete. To facilitate studying these questions, we present LMEnt, a suite for analyzing knowledge acquisition in LMs during pretraining. LMEnt introduces: (1) a knowledge-rich pretraining corpus, fully annotated with entity mentions, based on Wikipedia, (2) an entity-based retrieval method over pretraining data that outperforms previous approaches by as much as 80.4%, and (3) 12 pretrained models with up to 1B parameters and 4K intermediate checkpoints, with comparable performance to popular open-sourced models on knowledge benchmarks. Together, these resources provide a controlled environment for analyzing connections between entity mentions in pretraining and downstream performance, and the effects of causal interventions in pretraining data. We show the utility of LMEnt by studying knowledge acquisition across checkpoints, finding that fact frequency is key, but does not fully explain learning trends. We release LMEnt to support studies of knowledge in LMs, including knowledge representations, plasticity, editing, attribution, and learning dynamics.

Title: Mixture of Global and Local Experts with Diffusion Transformer for
  Controllable Face Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00428
Summary: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1) Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its robust zero-shot generalization capability.

Title: MOSAIC: Multi-Subject Personalized Generation via Correspondence-Aware
  Alignment and Disentanglement
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01977
Summary: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference. To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably, while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications.

Title: Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00375
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek{this repository}.

Title: Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01106
Summary: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

Title: On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21038
Summary: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings, there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

Title: Flavors of Moonshine: Tiny Specialized ASR Models for Edge Devices
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02523
Summary: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages. Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters), training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size, enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

Title: Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01790
Summary: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Title: Gated Associative Memory: A Parallel O(N) Architecture for Efficient
  Sequence Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00605
Summary: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)), creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper, we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local, position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2 benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

Title: DynaGuard: A Dynamic Guardrail Model With User-Defined Policies
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02563
Summary: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Title: Stairway to Fairness: Connecting Group and Individual Fairness
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21334
Summary: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3 datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/theresiavr/stairway-to-fairness.

Title: ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long
  Video Understanding
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21496
Summary: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

Title: FastFit: Accelerating Multi-Reference Virtual Try-On via Cacheable
  Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20586
Summary: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead. This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode, and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in inference efficiency.

Title: DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02333
Summary: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO (20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Title: Benchmarking Optimizers for Large Language Model Pretraining
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01440
Summary: The recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been accompanied by an effervescence of novel ideas and methods to better optimize the loss of deep learning models. Claims from those methods are myriad: from faster convergence to removing reliance on certain hyperparameters. However, the diverse experimental protocols used to validate these claims make direct comparisons between methods challenging. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of recent optimization techniques across standardized LLM pretraining scenarios, systematically varying model size, batch size, and training duration. Through careful tuning of each method, we provide guidance to practitioners on which optimizer is best suited for each scenario. For researchers, our work highlights promising directions for future optimization research. Finally, by releasing our code and making all experiments fully reproducible, we hope our efforts can help the development and rigorous benchmarking of future methods.

Title: ViSTA-SLAM: Visual SLAM with Symmetric Two-view Association
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01584
Summary: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly, the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in both camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current methods.

Title: The Gold Medals in an Empty Room: Diagnosing Metalinguistic Reasoning in
  LLMs with Camlang
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00425
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup, and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang, creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human metalinguistic competence.

Title: MobiAgent: A Systematic Framework for Customizable Mobile Agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00531
Summary: With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), GUI-based mobile agents have emerged as a key development direction for intelligent mobile systems. However, existing agent models continue to face significant challenges in real-world task execution, particularly in terms of accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MobiAgent, a comprehensive mobile agent system comprising three core components: the MobiMind-series agent models, the AgentRR acceleration framework, and the MobiFlow benchmarking suite. Furthermore, recognizing that the capabilities of current mobile agents are still limited by the availability of high-quality data, we have developed an AI-assisted agile data collection pipeline that significantly reduces the cost of manual annotation. Compared to both general-purpose LLMs and specialized GUI agent models, MobiAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world mobile scenarios.

Title: Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02046
Summary: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining, despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum). We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios, performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

Title: Metis: Training Large Language Models with Advanced Low-Bit Quantization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00404
Summary: This work identifies anisotropic parameter distributions as a fundamental barrier to training large language models (LLMs) with low-bit quantization: a few dominant singular values create wide numerical ranges that conflict with the inherent bias of block-wise quantization. This bias disproportionately preserves high-magnitude values while discarding smaller ones, causing training instability and low model performance. This work introduces Metis, a training framework that combines (i) spectral decomposition with random embedding to efficiently disentangle dominant from long-tail components, compressing broad distributions into quantization-friendly narrow ranges; (ii) adaptive learning rates in the spectral domain to amplify underrepresented directions and better capture diverse features critical for performance; and (iii) a dual-range regularizer that jointly constrains numerical precision and parameter range distribution, ensuring stable, unbiased low-bit training. With Metis, FP8 training surpasses FP32 baselines, and FP4 training achieves accuracy comparable to FP32, paving the way for robust and scalable LLM training under advanced low-bit quantization. The code implementation for Metis is available at: https://github.com/typename-yyf/Metis-quantization.

Title: SQL-of-Thought: Multi-agentic Text-to-SQL with Guided Error Correction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00581
Summary: Converting natural language queries into SQL queries is a crucial challenge in both industry and academia, aiming to increase access to databases and large-scale applications. This work examines how in-context learning and chain-of-thought can be utilized to develop a robust solution for text-to-SQL systems. We propose SQL-of-Thought: a multi-agent framework that decomposes the Text2SQL task into schema linking, subproblem identification, query plan generation, SQL generation, and a guided correction loop. Unlike prior systems that rely only on execution-based static correction, we introduce taxonomy-guided dynamic error modification informed by in-context learning. SQL-of-Thought achieves state-of-the-art results on the Spider dataset and its variants, combining guided error taxonomy with reasoning-based query planning.

Title: AMBEDKAR-A Multi-level Bias Elimination through a Decoding Approach with
  Knowledge Augmentation for Robust Constitutional Alignment of Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02133
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to 17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

Title: Reasoning Vectors: Transferring Chain-of-Thought Capabilities via Task
  Arithmetic
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01363
Summary: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning vector: v_{reason} = theta_{GRPO} - theta_{SFT}. We hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by recycling prior computational investments.

Title: GenCompositor: Generative Video Compositing with Diffusion Transformer
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02460
Summary: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production, serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production. Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration, resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner, allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE). Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task, called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in fidelity and consistency.

Title: Baichuan-M2: Scaling Medical Capability with Large Verifier System
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02208
Summary: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.

Title: C-DiffDet+: Fusing Global Scene Context with Generative Denoising for
  High-Fidelity Object Detection
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00578
Summary: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

Title: VerlTool: Towards Holistic Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool Use
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01055
Summary: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2times speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Title: FlashAdventure: A Benchmark for GUI Agents Solving Full Story Arcs in
  Diverse Adventure Games
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01052
Summary: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

Title: UI-TARS-2 Technical Report: Advancing GUI Agent with Multi-Turn
  Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02544
Summary: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Title: Discrete Noise Inversion for Next-scale Autoregressive Text-based Image
  Editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01984
Summary: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing approach.

Title: Attributes as Textual Genes: Leveraging LLMs as Genetic Algorithm
  Simulators for Conditional Synthetic Data Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02040
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

Title: LLaVA-Critic-R1: Your Critic Model is Secretly a Strong Policy Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00676
Summary: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model, producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly, LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B). Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale. Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems.

Title: OpenVision 2: A Family of Generative Pretrained Visual Encoders for
  Multimodal Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01644
Summary: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder (and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2 competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x (from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB, equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models.

Title: Kwai Keye-VL 1.5 Technical Report
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01563
Summary: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5, which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity, processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution (Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment, incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

Title: Improving Large Vision and Language Models by Learning from a Panel of
  Peers
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01610
Summary: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to 57%

Title: The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02547
Summary: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Title: POINTS-Reader: Distillation-Free Adaptation of Vision-Language Models
  for Document Conversion
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01215
Summary: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables, formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents. Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents, then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at https://github.com/Tencent/POINTS-Reader.

Title: M3Ret: Unleashing Zero-shot Multimodal Medical Image Retrieval via
  Self-Supervision
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01360
Summary: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet, current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including 2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image understanding.

Title: SimpleTIR: End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Turn
  Tool-Integrated Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02479
Summary: Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly improve their reasoning capabilities by interacting with external tools, a paradigm known as Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). However, extending TIR to multi-turn scenarios using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often hindered by training instability and performance collapse. We identify that such instability is primarily caused by a distributional drift from external tool feedback, leading to the generation of low-probability tokens. This issue compounds over successive turns, causing catastrophic gradient norm explosions that derail the training process. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleTIR , a plug-and-play algorithm that stabilizes multi-turn TIR training. Its core strategy is to identify and filter out trajectories containing void turns, i.e., turns that yield neither a code block nor a final answer. By removing these problematic trajectories from the policy update, SimpleTIR effectively blocks the harmful, high-magnitude gradients, thus stabilizing the learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show that SimpleTIR achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging math reasoning benchmarks, notably elevating the AIME24 score from a text-only baseline of 22.1 to 50.5 when starting from the Qwen2.5-7B base model. Furthermore, by avoiding the constraints of supervised fine-tuning, SimpleTIR encourages the model to discover diverse and sophisticated reasoning patterns, such as self-correction and cross-validation.

Title: Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud
  Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01250
Summary: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain. In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which enables our method to surpass previous single-modal self-reconstruction methods in 3D self-supervised learning. Specifically, it outperforms the self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three variants of ScanObjectNN with the Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol. The code is available at https://github.com/aHapBean/Point-PQAE.

Title: Universal Deep Research: Bring Your Own Model and Strategy
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00244
Summary: Deep research tools are among the most impactful and most commonly encountered agentic systems today. We observe, however, that each deep research agent introduced so far is hard-coded to carry out a particular research strategy using a fixed choice of tools. We introduce Universal Deep Research (UDR), a generalist agentic system that wraps around any language model and enables the user to create, edit, and refine their own entirely custom deep research strategies without any need for additional training or finetuning. To showcase the generality of our system, we equip UDR with example minimal, expansive, and intensive research strategies, and provide a user interface to facilitate experimentation with the system.

Title: MedDINOv3: How to adapt vision foundation models for medical image
  segmentation?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02379
Summary: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ricklisz/MedDINOv3.

Title: Jointly Reinforcing Diversity and Quality in Language Model Generations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02534
Summary: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity. At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning, encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as higher-quality responses.

Title: Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for
  RLVR
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02522
Summary: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose PACS, a novel RLVR framework that achieves imPlicit Actor Critic coupling via a Supervised learning framework. By treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32 and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Title: Democracy-in-Silico: Institutional Design as Alignment in AI-Governed
  Polities
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19562
Summary: This paper introduces Democracy-in-Silico, an agent-based simulation where societies of advanced AI agents, imbued with complex psychological personas, govern themselves under different institutional frameworks. We explore what it means to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to embody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological triggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under various stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our findings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of a Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves as a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt power-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare compared to less constrained democratic models. The simulation reveals that an institutional design may offer a framework for aligning the complex, emergent behaviors of future artificial agent societies, forcing us to reconsider what human rituals and responsibilities are essential in an age of shared authorship with non-human entities.

Title: From reactive to cognitive: brain-inspired spatial intelligence for
  embodied agents
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17198
Summary: Spatial cognition enables adaptive goal-directed behavior by constructing internal models of space. Robust biological systems consolidate spatial knowledge into three interconnected forms: landmarks for salient cues, route knowledge for movement trajectories, and survey knowledge for map-like representations. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled visual-language reasoning in embodied agents, these efforts lack structured spatial memory and instead operate reactively, limiting their generalization and adaptability in complex real-world environments. Here we present Brain-inspired Spatial Cognition for Navigation (BSC-Nav), a unified framework for constructing and leveraging structured spatial memory in embodied agents. BSC-Nav builds allocentric cognitive maps from egocentric trajectories and contextual cues, and dynamically retrieves spatial knowledge aligned with semantic goals. Integrated with powerful MLLMs, BSC-Nav achieves state-of-the-art efficacy and efficiency across diverse navigation tasks, demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, and supports versatile embodied behaviors in the real physical world, offering a scalable and biologically grounded path toward general-purpose spatial intelligence.
