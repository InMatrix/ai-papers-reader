Title: Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing Strategy for Mixture-of-Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15664
Summary: For Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, an unbalanced expert load will lead to routing collapse or increased computational overhead. Existing methods commonly employ an auxiliary loss to encourage load balance, but a large auxiliary loss will introduce non-negligible interference gradients into training and thus impair the model performance. In order to control load balance while not producing undesired gradients during training, we propose Loss-Free Balancing, featured by an auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy. To be specific, before the top-K routing decision, Loss-Free Balancing will first apply an expert-wise bias to the routing scores of each expert. By dynamically updating the bias of each expert according to its recent load, Loss-Free Balancing can consistently maintain a balanced distribution of expert load. In addition, since Loss-Free Balancing does not produce any interference gradients, it also elevates the upper bound of model performance gained from MoE training. We validate the performance of Loss-Free Balancing on MoE models with up to 3B parameters trained on up to 200B tokens. Experimental results show that Loss-Free Balancing achieves both better performance and better load balance compared with traditional auxiliary-loss-controlled load balancing strategies.

Title: Efficient LLM Scheduling by Learning to Rank
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15792
Summary: In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, the output length of an LLM request is typically regarded as not known a priori. Consequently, most LLM serving systems employ a simple First-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling strategy, leading to Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking and reduced throughput and service quality. In this paper, we reexamine this assumption -- we show that, although predicting the exact generation length of each request is infeasible, it is possible to predict the relative ranks of output lengths in a batch of requests, using learning to rank. The ranking information offers valuable guidance for scheduling requests. Building on this insight, we develop a novel scheduler for LLM inference and serving that can approximate the shortest-job-first (SJF) schedule better than existing approaches. We integrate this scheduler with the state-of-the-art LLM serving system and show significant performance improvement in several important applications: 2.8x lower latency in chatbot serving and 6.5x higher throughput in synthetic data generation.

Title: Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for One-step Diffusion Distillation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15991
Summary: Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into an one-step student generator, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack) for distilling student generators. DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of teacher models, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the intermediate distributions of teacher models. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions for approximating the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.

PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15836
Summary: The exponential growth of scientific literature necessitates advanced tools for effective knowledge exploration. We present Knowledge Navigator, a system designed to enhance exploratory search abilities by organizing and structuring the retrieved documents from broad topical queries into a navigable, two-level hierarchy of named and descriptive scientific topics and subtopics. This structured organization provides an overall view of the research themes in a domain, while also enabling iterative search and deeper knowledge discovery within specific subtopics by allowing users to refine their focus and retrieve additional relevant documents.

Title: BaichuanSEED: Sharing the Potential of ExtensivE Data Collection and Deduplication by Introducing a Competitive Large Language Model Baseline
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15079
Summary: The general capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) highly rely on the composition and selection on extensive pretraining datasets, treated as commercial secrets by several institutions. To mitigate this issue, we open-source the details of a universally applicable data processing pipeline and validate its effectiveness and potential by introducing a competitive LLM baseline. Specifically, the data processing pipeline consists of broad collection to scale up and reweighting to improve quality. We then pretrain a 7B model BaichuanSEED with 3T tokens processed by our pipeline without any deliberate downstream task-related optimization, followed by an easy but effective supervised fine-tuning stage. BaichuanSEED demonstrates consistency and predictability throughout training and achieves comparable performance on comprehensive benchmarks with several commercial advanced large language models, such as Qwen1.5 and Llama3. We also conduct several heuristic experiments to discuss the potential for further optimization of downstream tasks, such as mathematics and coding.

Title: In-Context Imitation Learning via Next-Token Prediction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15980
Summary: We explore how to enhance next-token prediction models to perform in-context imitation learning on a real robot, where the robot executes new tasks by interpreting contextual information provided during the input phase, without updating its underlying policy parameters. We propose In-Context Robot Transformer (ICRT), a causal transformer that performs autoregressive prediction on sensorimotor trajectories without relying on any linguistic data or reward function. This formulation enables flexible and training-free execution of new tasks at test time, achieved by prompting the model with sensorimotor trajectories of the new task composing of image observations, actions and states tuples, collected through human teleoperation. Experiments with a Franka Emika robot demonstrate that the ICRT can adapt to new tasks specified by prompts, even in environment configurations that differ from both the prompt and the training data. In a multitask environment setup, ICRT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art next-token prediction models in robotics on generalizing to unseen tasks. Code, checkpoints and data are available on https://icrt.dev/

Title: ReMamba: Equip Mamba with Effective Long-Sequence Modeling
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15496
Summary: While the Mamba architecture demonstrates superior inference efficiency and competitive performance on short-context natural language processing (NLP) tasks, empirical evidence suggests its capacity to comprehend long contexts is limited compared to transformer-based models. In this study, we investigate the long-context efficiency issues of the Mamba models and propose ReMamba, which enhances Mamba's ability to comprehend long contexts. ReMamba incorporates selective compression and adaptation techniques within a two-stage re-forward process, incurring minimal additional inference costs overhead. Experimental results on the LongBench and L-Eval benchmarks demonstrate ReMamba's efficacy, improving over the baselines by 3.2 and 1.6 points, respectively, and attaining performance almost on par with same-size transformer models.

Title: Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15998
Summary: The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks. Models and code: https://github.com/NVlabs/Eagle

Title: TEDRA: Text-based Editing of Dynamic and Photoreal Actors
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15995
Summary: Over the past years, significant progress has been made in creating photorealistic and drivable 3D avatars solely from videos of real humans. However, a core remaining challenge is the fine-grained and user-friendly editing of clothing styles by means of textual descriptions. To this end, we present TEDRA, the first method allowing text-based edits of an avatar, which maintains the avatar's high fidelity, space-time coherency, as well as dynamics, and enables skeletal pose and view control. We begin by training a model to create a controllable and high-fidelity digital replica of the real actor. Next, we personalize a pretrained generative diffusion model by fine-tuning it on various frames of the real character captured from different camera angles, ensuring the digital representation faithfully captures the dynamics and movements of the real person. This two-stage process lays the foundation for our approach to dynamic human avatar editing. Utilizing this personalized diffusion model, we modify the dynamic avatar based on a provided text prompt using our Personalized Normal Aligned Score Distillation Sampling (PNA-SDS) within a model-based guidance framework. Additionally, we propose a time step annealing strategy to ensure high-quality edits. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over prior work in functionality and visual quality.

Title: LLaVA-MoD: Making LLaVA Tiny via MoE Knowledge Distillation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15881
Summary: We introduce LLaVA-MoD, a novel framework designed to enable the efficient training of small-scale Multimodal Language Models (s-MLLM) by distilling knowledge from large-scale MLLM (l-MLLM). Our approach tackles two fundamental challenges in MLLM distillation. First, we optimize the network structure of s-MLLM by integrating a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture into the language model, striking a balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Second, we propose a progressive knowledge transfer strategy to ensure comprehensive knowledge migration. This strategy begins with mimic distillation, where we minimize the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between output distributions to enable the student model to emulate the teacher network's understanding. Following this, we introduce preference distillation via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where the key lies in treating l-MLLM as the reference model. During this phase, the s-MLLM's ability to discriminate between superior and inferior examples is significantly enhanced beyond l-MLLM, leading to a better student that surpasses its teacher, particularly in hallucination benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-MoD outperforms existing models across various multimodal benchmarks while maintaining a minimal number of activated parameters and low computational costs. Remarkably, LLaVA-MoD, with only 2B activated parameters, surpasses Qwen-VL-Chat-7B by an average of 8.8% across benchmarks, using merely 0.3% of the training data and 23% trainable parameters. These results underscore LLaVA-MoD's ability to effectively distill comprehensive knowledge from its teacher model, paving the way for the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code will be available on: https://github.com/shufangxun/LLaVA-MoD.

Title: Towards Realistic Example-based Modeling via 3D Gaussian Stitching
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15708
Summary: Using parts of existing models to rebuild new models, commonly termed as example-based modeling, is a classical methodology in the realm of computer graphics. Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints. Extensive experimental results validate that our approach significantly outperforms previous works in terms of realistic synthesis, demonstrating its practicality. More demos are available at https://ingra14m.github.io/gs_stitching_website.

Title: Leveraging Open Knowledge for Advancing Task Expertise in Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15915
Summary: The cultivation of expertise for large language models (LLMs) to solve tasks of specific areas often requires special-purpose tuning with calibrated behaviors on the expected stable outputs. To avoid huge cost brought by manual preparation of instruction datasets and training resources up to hundreds of hours, the exploitation of open knowledge including a wealth of low rank adaptation (LoRA) models and instruction datasets serves as a good starting point. However, existing methods on model and data selection focus on the performance of general-purpose capabilities while neglecting the knowledge gap exposed in domain-specific deployment. In the present study, we propose to bridge such gap by introducing few human-annotated samples (i.e., K-shot) for advancing task expertise of LLMs with open knowledge. Specifically, we develop an efficient and scalable pipeline to cost-efficiently produce task experts where K-shot data intervene in selecting the most promising expert candidates and the task-relevant instructions. A mixture-of-expert (MoE) system is built to make the best use of individual-yet-complementary knowledge between multiple experts. We unveil the two keys to the success of a MoE system, 1) the abidance by K-shot, and 2) the insistence on diversity. For the former, we ensure that models that truly possess problem-solving abilities on K-shot are selected rather than those blind guessers. Besides, during data selection, instructions that share task-relevant contexts with K-shot are prioritized. For the latter, we highlight the diversity of constituting experts and that of the fine-tuning instructions throughout the model and data selection process. Extensive experimental results confirm the superiority of our approach over existing methods on utilization of open knowledge across various tasks. Codes and models will be released later.

Title: Dolphin: Long Context as a New Modality for Energy-Efficient On-Device Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15518
Summary: This paper presents Dolphin, a novel decoder-decoder architecture for energy-efficient processing of long contexts in language models. Our approach addresses the significant energy consumption and latency challenges inherent in on-device models. Dolphin employs a compact 0.5B parameter decoder to distill extensive contextual information into a memory embedding, substantially reducing the input length for the primary 7B parameter decoder model. Inspired by vision-language models, we repurpose the image embedding projector to encode long textual contexts, effectively treating extended context as a distinct modality. This innovative method enables processing of substantially longer contexts without the typical computational overhead associated with extended input sequences. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a 10-fold improvement in energy efficiency and a 5-fold reduction in latency compared to conventional full-length context processing methods without losing quality of the response. Our work contributes to the development of more sustainable and scalable language models for on-device applications, addressing the critical need for energy-efficient and responsive AI technologies in resource-constrained environments while maintaining the accuracy to understand long contexts. This research has implications for the broader field of natural language processing, particularly in the domain of efficient model design for resource-limited settings. By enabling more sophisticated AI capabilities on edge devices, Dolphin paves the way for advanced language processing in a wide range of applications where computational resources are at a premium. The Dolphin model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/NexaAIDev/Dolphin.

Title: LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14307
Summary: Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.

Title: Temporally-consistent 3D Reconstruction of Birds
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13629
Summary: This paper deals with 3D reconstruction of seabirds which recently came into focus of environmental scientists as valuable bio-indicators for environmental change. Such 3D information is beneficial for analyzing the bird's behavior and physiological shape, for example by tracking motion, shape, and appearance changes. From a computer vision perspective birds are especially challenging due to their rapid and oftentimes non-rigid motions. We propose an approach to reconstruct the 3D pose and shape from monocular videos of a specific breed of seabird - the common murre. Our approach comprises a full pipeline of detection, tracking, segmentation, and temporally consistent 3D reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a temporal loss that extends current single-image 3D bird pose estimators to the temporal domain. Moreover, we provide a real-world dataset of 10000 frames of video observations on average capture nine birds simultaneously, comprising a large variety of motions and interactions, including a smaller test set with bird-specific keypoint labels. Using our temporal optimization, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for the challenging sequences in our dataset.

Title: Writing in the Margins: Better Inference Pattern for Long Context Retrieval
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14906
Summary: In this paper, we introduce Writing in the Margins (WiM), a new inference pattern for Large Language Models designed to optimize the handling of long input sequences in retrieval-oriented tasks. This approach leverages the chunked prefill of the key-value cache to perform segment-wise inference, which enables efficient processing of extensive contexts along with the generation and classification of intermediate information ("margins") that guide the model towards specific tasks. This method increases computational overhead marginally while significantly enhancing the performance of off-the-shelf models without the need for fine-tuning. Specifically, we observe that WiM provides an average enhancement of 7.5% in accuracy for reasoning skills (HotpotQA, MultiHop-RAG) and more than a 30.0% increase in the F1-score for aggregation tasks (CWE). Additionally, we show how the proposed pattern fits into an interactive retrieval design that provides end-users with ongoing updates about the progress of context processing, and pinpoints the integration of relevant information into the final response. We release our implementation of WiM using Hugging Face Transformers library at https://github.com/writer/writing-in-the-margins.

Title: Generative Inbetweening: Adapting Image-to-Video Models for Keyframe Interpolation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15239
Summary: We present a method for generating video sequences with coherent motion between a pair of input key frames. We adapt a pretrained large-scale image-to-video diffusion model (originally trained to generate videos moving forward in time from a single input image) for key frame interpolation, i.e., to produce a video in between two input frames. We accomplish this adaptation through a lightweight fine-tuning technique that produces a version of the model that instead predicts videos moving backwards in time from a single input image. This model (along with the original forward-moving model) is subsequently used in a dual-directional diffusion sampling process that combines the overlapping model estimates starting from each of the two keyframes. Our experiments show that our method outperforms both existing diffusion-based methods and traditional frame interpolation techniques.

Title: The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15237
Summary: Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best instruction-tuned linear RNN model.

Title: Diffusion Models Are Real-Time Game Engines
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14837
Summary: We present GameNGen, the first game engine powered entirely by a neural model that enables real-time interaction with a complex environment over long trajectories at high quality. GameNGen can interactively simulate the classic game DOOM at over 20 frames per second on a single TPU. Next frame prediction achieves a PSNR of 29.4, comparable to lossy JPEG compression. Human raters are only slightly better than random chance at distinguishing short clips of the game from clips of the simulation. GameNGen is trained in two phases: (1) an RL-agent learns to play the game and the training sessions are recorded, and (2) a diffusion model is trained to produce the next frame, conditioned on the sequence of past frames and actions. Conditioning augmentations enable stable auto-regressive generation over long trajectories.

Title: Text2SQL is Not Enough: Unifying AI and Databases with TAG
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14717
Summary: AI systems that serve natural language questions over databases promise to unlock tremendous value. Such systems would allow users to leverage the powerful reasoning and knowledge capabilities of language models (LMs) alongside the scalable computational power of data management systems. These combined capabilities would empower users to ask arbitrary natural language questions over custom data sources. However, existing methods and benchmarks insufficiently explore this setting. Text2SQL methods focus solely on natural language questions that can be expressed in relational algebra, representing a small subset of the questions real users wish to ask. Likewise, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) considers the limited subset of queries that can be answered with point lookups to one or a few data records within the database. We propose Table-Augmented Generation (TAG), a unified and general-purpose paradigm for answering natural language questions over databases. The TAG model represents a wide range of interactions between the LM and database that have been previously unexplored and creates exciting research opportunities for leveraging the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LMs over data. We systematically develop benchmarks to study the TAG problem and find that standard methods answer no more than 20% of queries correctly, confirming the need for further research in this area. We release code for the benchmark at https://github.com/TAG-Research/TAG-Bench.

Title: Build-A-Scene: Interactive 3D Layout Control for Diffusion-Based Image Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14819
Summary: We propose a diffusion-based approach for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation with interactive 3D layout control. Layout control has been widely studied to alleviate the shortcomings of T2I diffusion models in understanding objects' placement and relationships from text descriptions. Nevertheless, existing approaches for layout control are limited to 2D layouts, require the user to provide a static layout beforehand, and fail to preserve generated images under layout changes. This makes these approaches unsuitable for applications that require 3D object-wise control and iterative refinements, e.g., interior design and complex scene generation. To this end, we leverage the recent advancements in depth-conditioned T2I models and propose a novel approach for interactive 3D layout control. We replace the traditional 2D boxes used in layout control with 3D boxes. Furthermore, we revamp the T2I task as a multi-stage generation process, where at each stage, the user can insert, change, and move an object in 3D while preserving objects from earlier stages. We achieve this through our proposed Dynamic Self-Attention (DSA) module and the consistent 3D object translation strategy. Experiments show that our approach can generate complicated scenes based on 3D layouts, boosting the object generation success rate over the standard depth-conditioned T2I methods by 2x. Moreover, it outperforms other methods in comparison in preserving objects under layout changes. Project Page: https://abdo-eldesokey.github.io/build-a-scene/

Title: GenCA: A Text-conditioned Generative Model for Realistic and Drivable Codec Avatars
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13674
Summary: Photo-realistic and controllable 3D avatars are crucial for various applications such as virtual and mixed reality (VR/MR), telepresence, gaming, and film production. Traditional methods for avatar creation often involve time-consuming scanning and reconstruction processes for each avatar, which limits their scalability. Furthermore, these methods do not offer the flexibility to sample new identities or modify existing ones. On the other hand, by learning a strong prior from data, generative models provide a promising alternative to traditional reconstruction methods, easing the time constraints for both data capture and processing. Additionally, generative methods enable downstream applications beyond reconstruction, such as editing and stylization. Nonetheless, the research on generative 3D avatars is still in its infancy, and therefore current methods still have limitations such as creating static avatars, lacking photo-realism, having incomplete facial details, or having limited drivability. To address this, we propose a text-conditioned generative model that can generate photo-realistic facial avatars of diverse identities, with more complete details like hair, eyes and mouth interior, and which can be driven through a powerful non-parametric latent expression space. Specifically, we integrate the generative and editing capabilities of latent diffusion models with a strong prior model for avatar expression driving.   Our model can generate and control high-fidelity avatars, even those out-of-distribution. We also highlight its potential for downstream applications, including avatar editing and single-shot avatar reconstruction.

Title: Platypus: A Generalized Specialist Model for Reading Text in Various Forms
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14805
Summary: Reading text from images (either natural scenes or documents) has been a long-standing research topic for decades, due to the high technical challenge and wide application range. Previously, individual specialist models are developed to tackle the sub-tasks of text reading (e.g., scene text recognition, handwritten text recognition and mathematical expression recognition). However, such specialist models usually cannot effectively generalize across different sub-tasks. Recently, generalist models (such as GPT-4V), trained on tremendous data in a unified way, have shown enormous potential in reading text in various scenarios, but with the drawbacks of limited accuracy and low efficiency. In this work, we propose Platypus, a generalized specialist model for text reading. Specifically, Platypus combines the best of both worlds: being able to recognize text of various forms with a single unified architecture, while achieving excellent accuracy and high efficiency. To better exploit the advantage of Platypus, we also construct a text reading dataset (called Worms), the images of which are curated from previous datasets and partially re-labeled. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed Platypus model. Model and data will be made publicly available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/AdvancedLiterateMachinery/tree/main/OCR/Platypus.

Title: NanoFlow: Towards Optimal Large Language Model Serving Throughput
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12757
Summary: The increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in a surging demand for planet-scale serving systems, where tens of thousands of GPUs continuously serve hundreds of millions of users. Consequently, throughput (under reasonable latency constraints) has emerged as a key metric that determines serving systems' performance. To boost throughput, various methods of inter-device parallelism (e.g., data, tensor, pipeline) have been explored. However, existing methods do not consider overlapping the utilization of different resources within a single device, leading to underutilization and sub-optimal performance.   We propose NanoFlow, a novel serving framework that exploits intra-device parallelism, which overlaps the usage of resources including compute, memory, and network within a single device through operation co-scheduling. To exploit intra-device parallelism, NanoFlow introduces two key innovations: First, NanoFlow splits requests into nano-batches at the granularity of operations, which breaks the dependency of sequential operations in LLM inference and enables overlapping; then, to get benefit from overlapping, NanoFlow uses an operation-level pipeline with execution unit scheduling, which partitions the device's functional units and simultaneously executes different operations in each unit. NanoFlow automates the pipeline setup using a parameter search algorithm, which enables easily porting NanoFlow to different models. We implement NanoFlow on NVIDIA GPUs and evaluate end-to-end serving throughput on several popular models such as LLaMA-2-70B, Mixtral 8x7B, LLaMA-3-8B, etc.. With practical workloads, NanoFlow provides 1.91x throughput boost compared to state-of-the-art serving systems achieving 59% to 72% of optimal throughput across ported models.

Title: MagicMan: Generative Novel View Synthesis of Humans with 3D-Aware Diffusion and Iterative Refinement
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14211
Summary: Existing works in single-image human reconstruction suffer from weak generalizability due to insufficient training data or 3D inconsistencies for a lack of comprehensive multi-view knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MagicMan, a human-specific multi-view diffusion model designed to generate high-quality novel view images from a single reference image. As its core, we leverage a pre-trained 2D diffusion model as the generative prior for generalizability, with the parametric SMPL-X model as the 3D body prior to promote 3D awareness. To tackle the critical challenge of maintaining consistency while achieving dense multi-view generation for improved 3D human reconstruction, we first introduce hybrid multi-view attention to facilitate both efficient and thorough information interchange across different views. Additionally, we present a geometry-aware dual branch to perform concurrent generation in both RGB and normal domains, further enhancing consistency via geometry cues. Last but not least, to address ill-shaped issues arising from inaccurate SMPL-X estimation that conflicts with the reference image, we propose a novel iterative refinement strategy, which progressively optimizes SMPL-X accuracy while enhancing the quality and consistency of the generated multi-views. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both novel view synthesis and subsequent 3D human reconstruction tasks.

Title: Foundation Models for Music: A Survey
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14340
Summary: In recent years, foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and latent diffusion models (LDMs) have profoundly impacted diverse sectors, including music. This comprehensive review examines state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained models and foundation models in music, spanning from representation learning, generative learning and multimodal learning. We first contextualise the significance of music in various industries and trace the evolution of AI in music. By delineating the modalities targeted by foundation models, we discover many of the music representations are underexplored in FM development. Then, emphasis is placed on the lack of versatility of previous methods on diverse music applications, along with the potential of FMs in music understanding, generation and medical application. By comprehensively exploring the details of the model pre-training paradigm, architectural choices, tokenisation, finetuning methodologies and controllability, we emphasise the important topics that should have been well explored, like instruction tuning and in-context learning, scaling law and emergent ability, as well as long-sequence modelling etc. A dedicated section presents insights into music agents, accompanied by a thorough analysis of datasets and evaluations essential for pre-training and downstream tasks. Finally, by underscoring the vital importance of ethical considerations, we advocate that following research on FM for music should focus more on such issues as interpretability, transparency, human responsibility, and copyright issues. The paper offers insights into future challenges and trends on FMs for music, aiming to shape the trajectory of human-AI collaboration in the music realm.

Title: SwiftBrush v2: Make Your One-step Diffusion Model Better Than Its Teacher
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14176
Summary: In this paper, we aim to enhance the performance of SwiftBrush, a prominent one-step text-to-image diffusion model, to be competitive with its multi-step Stable Diffusion counterpart. Initially, we explore the quality-diversity trade-off between SwiftBrush and SD Turbo: the former excels in image diversity, while the latter excels in image quality. This observation motivates our proposed modifications in the training methodology, including better weight initialization and efficient LoRA training. Moreover, our introduction of a novel clamped CLIP loss enhances image-text alignment and results in improved image quality. Remarkably, by combining the weights of models trained with efficient LoRA and full training, we achieve a new state-of-the-art one-step diffusion model, achieving an FID of 8.14 and surpassing all GAN-based and multi-step Stable Diffusion models. The evaluation code is available at: https://github.com/vinairesearch/swiftbrushv2.

Title: Learning to Move Like Professional Counter-Strike Players
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13934
Summary: In multiplayer, first-person shooter games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), coordinated movement is a critical component of high-level strategic play. However, the complexity of team coordination and the variety of conditions present in popular game maps make it impractical to author hand-crafted movement policies for every scenario. We show that it is possible to take a data-driven approach to creating human-like movement controllers for CS:GO. We curate a team movement dataset comprising 123 hours of professional game play traces, and use this dataset to train a transformer-based movement model that generates human-like team movement for all players in a "Retakes" round of the game. Importantly, the movement prediction model is efficient. Performing inference for all players takes less than 0.5 ms per game step (amortized cost) on a single CPU core, making it plausible for use in commercial games today. Human evaluators assess that our model behaves more like humans than both commercially-available bots and procedural movement controllers scripted by experts (16% to 59% higher by TrueSkill rating of "human-like"). Using experiments involving in-game bot vs. bot self-play, we demonstrate that our model performs simple forms of teamwork, makes fewer common movement mistakes, and yields movement distributions, player lifetimes, and kill locations similar to those observed in professional CS:GO match play.

Title: MobileQuant: Mobile-friendly Quantization for On-device Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13933
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized language processing, delivering outstanding results across multiple applications. However, deploying LLMs on edge devices poses several challenges with respect to memory, energy, and compute costs, limiting their widespread use in devices such as mobile phones. A promising solution is to reduce the number of bits used to represent weights and activations. While existing works have found partial success at quantizing LLMs to lower bitwidths, e.g. 4-bit weights, quantizing activations beyond 16 bits often leads to large computational overheads due to poor on-device quantization support, or a considerable accuracy drop. Yet, 8-bit activations are very attractive for on-device deployment as they would enable LLMs to fully exploit mobile-friendly hardware, e.g. Neural Processing Units (NPUs). In this work, we make a first attempt to facilitate the on-device deployment of LLMs using integer-only quantization. We first investigate the limitations of existing quantization methods for on-device deployment, with a special focus on activation quantization. We then address these limitations by introducing a simple post-training quantization method, named MobileQuant, that extends previous weight equivalent transformation works by jointly optimizing the weight transformation and activation range parameters in an end-to-end manner. MobileQuant demonstrates superior capabilities over existing methods by 1) achieving near-lossless quantization on a wide range of LLM benchmarks, 2) reducing latency and energy consumption by 20\%-50\% compared to current on-device quantization strategies, 3) requiring limited compute budget, 4) being compatible with mobile-friendly compute units, e.g. NPU.

Title: K-Sort Arena: Efficient and Reliable Benchmarking for Generative Models via K-wise Human Preferences
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14468
Summary: The rapid advancement of visual generative models necessitates efficient and reliable evaluation methods. Arena platform, which gathers user votes on model comparisons, can rank models with human preferences. However, traditional Arena methods, while established, require an excessive number of comparisons for ranking to converge and are vulnerable to preference noise in voting, suggesting the need for better approaches tailored to contemporary evaluation challenges. In this paper, we introduce K-Sort Arena, an efficient and reliable platform based on a key insight: images and videos possess higher perceptual intuitiveness than texts, enabling rapid evaluation of multiple samples simultaneously. Consequently, K-Sort Arena employs K-wise comparisons, allowing K models to engage in free-for-all competitions, which yield much richer information than pairwise comparisons. To enhance the robustness of the system, we leverage probabilistic modeling and Bayesian updating techniques. We propose an exploration-exploitation-based matchmaking strategy to facilitate more informative comparisons. In our experiments, K-Sort Arena exhibits 16.3x faster convergence compared to the widely used ELO algorithm. To further validate the superiority and obtain a comprehensive leaderboard, we collect human feedback via crowdsourced evaluations of numerous cutting-edge text-to-image and text-to-video models. Thanks to its high efficiency, K-Sort Arena can continuously incorporate emerging models and update the leaderboard with minimal votes. Our project has undergone several months of internal testing and is now available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ksort/K-Sort-Arena

Title: LlamaDuo: LLMOps Pipeline for Seamless Migration from Service LLMs to Small-Scale Local LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13467
Summary: The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is enhanced by further fine-tuning with additional similar data created by the service LLM. This iterative process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks. Our pipeline implementation is available at https://github.com/deep-diver/llamaduo.

Title: LLaVaOLMoBitnet1B: Ternary LLM goes Multimodal!
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13402
Summary: Multimodal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs) have seen significant advancements in the last year, demonstrating impressive performance across tasks. However, to truly democratize AI, models must exhibit strong capabilities and be able to run efficiently on small compute footprints accessible by most. Part of this quest, we introduce LLaVaOLMoBitnet1B - the first Ternary Multimodal LLM capable of accepting Image(s)+Text inputs to produce coherent textual responses. The model is fully open-sourced along with training scripts to encourage further research in this space. This accompanying technical report highlights the training process, evaluation details, challenges associated with ternary models and future opportunities.

Title: Power Scheduler: A Batch Size and Token Number Agnostic Learning Rate Scheduler
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13359
Summary: Finding the optimal learning rate for language model pretraining is a challenging task. This is not only because there is a complicated correlation between learning rate, batch size, number of training tokens, model size, and other hyperparameters but also because it is prohibitively expensive to perform a hyperparameter search for large language models with Billions or Trillions of parameters. Recent studies propose using small proxy models and small corpus to perform hyperparameter searches and transposing the optimal parameters to large models and large corpus. While the zero-shot transferability is theoretically and empirically proven for model size related hyperparameters, like depth and width, the zero-shot transfer from small corpus to large corpus is underexplored. In this paper, we study the correlation between optimal learning rate, batch size, and number of training tokens for the recently proposed WSD scheduler. After thousands of small experiments, we found a power-law relationship between variables and demonstrated its transferability across model sizes. Based on the observation, we propose a new learning rate scheduler, Power scheduler, that is agnostic about the number of training tokens and batch size. The experiment shows that combining the Power scheduler with Maximum Update Parameterization (muP) can consistently achieve impressive performance with one set of hyperparameters regardless of the number of training tokens, batch size, model size, and even model architecture. Our 3B dense and MoE models trained with the Power scheduler achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-art small language models. We open-source these pretrained models at https://ibm.biz/BdKhLa.

Title: SWE-bench-java: A GitHub Issue Resolving Benchmark for Java
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14354
Summary: GitHub issue resolving is a critical task in software engineering, recently gaining significant attention in both industry and academia. Within this task, SWE-bench has been released to evaluate issue resolving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but has so far only focused on Python version. However, supporting more programming languages is also important, as there is a strong demand in industry. As a first step toward multilingual support, we have developed a Java version of SWE-bench, called SWE-bench-java. We have publicly released the dataset, along with the corresponding Docker-based evaluation environment and leaderboard, which will be continuously maintained and updated in the coming months. To verify the reliability of SWE-bench-java, we implement a classic method SWE-agent and test several powerful LLMs on it. As is well known, developing a high-quality multi-lingual benchmark is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so we welcome contributions through pull requests or collaboration to accelerate its iteration and refinement, paving the way for fully automated programming.

Title: Training-free Long Video Generation with Chain of Diffusion Model Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13423
Summary: Video generation models hold substantial potential in areas such as filmmaking. However, current video diffusion models need high computational costs and produce suboptimal results due to high complexity of video generation task. In this paper, we propose ConFiner, an efficient high-quality video generation framework that decouples video generation into easier subtasks: structure control and spatial-temporal refinement. It can generate high-quality videos with chain of off-the-shelf diffusion model experts, each expert responsible for a decoupled subtask. During the refinement, we introduce coordinated denoising, which can merge multiple diffusion experts' capabilities into a single sampling. Furthermore, we design ConFiner-Long framework, which can generate long coherent video with three constraint strategies on ConFiner. Experimental results indicate that with only 10\% of the inference cost, our ConFiner surpasses representative models like Lavie and Modelscope across all objective and subjective metrics. And ConFiner-Long can generate high-quality and coherent videos with up to 600 frames.

Title: TVG: A Training-free Transition Video Generation Method with Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13413
Summary: Transition videos play a crucial role in media production, enhancing the flow and coherence of visual narratives. Traditional methods like morphing often lack artistic appeal and require specialized skills, limiting their effectiveness. Recent advances in diffusion model-based video generation offer new possibilities for creating transitions but face challenges such as poor inter-frame relationship modeling and abrupt content changes. We propose a novel training-free Transition Video Generation (TVG) approach using video-level diffusion models that addresses these limitations without additional training. Our method leverages Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to model latent representations, ensuring smooth and dynamic transitions between frames. Additionally, we introduce interpolation-based conditional controls and a Frequency-aware Bidirectional Fusion (FBiF) architecture to enhance temporal control and transition reliability. Evaluations of benchmark datasets and custom image pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-quality smooth transition videos. The code are provided in https://sobeymil.github.io/tvg.com.

Title: Efficient Detection of Toxic Prompts in Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11727
Summary: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.

Title: RoundTable: Leveraging Dynamic Schema and Contextual Autocomplete for Enhanced Query Precision in Tabular Question Answering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12369
Summary: With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), a major use case that has emerged is querying databases in plain English, translating user questions into executable database queries, which has improved significantly. However, real-world datasets often feature a vast array of attributes and complex values, complicating the LLMs task of accurately identifying relevant columns or values from natural language queries. Traditional methods cannot fully relay the datasets size and complexity to the LLM. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that leverages Full-Text Search (FTS) on the input table. This approach not only enables precise detection of specific values and columns but also narrows the search space for language models, thereby enhancing query accuracy. Additionally, it supports a custom auto-complete feature that suggests queries based on the data in the table. This integration significantly refines the interaction between the user and complex datasets, offering a sophisticated solution to the limitations faced by current table querying capabilities. This work is accompanied by an application for both Mac and Windows platforms, which readers can try out themselves on their own data.

Title: HiRED: Attention-Guided Token Dropping for Efficient Inference of High-Resolution Vision-Language Models in Resource-Constrained Environments
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10945
Summary: High-resolution Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in multimodal tasks to enhance accuracy by preserving detailed image information. However, these models often generate excessive visual tokens due to encoding multiple partitions of the input image. Processing these excessive visual tokens is computationally challenging, especially in resource-constrained environments with commodity GPUs. To support high-resolution images while meeting resource constraints, we propose High-Resolution Early Dropping (HiRED), a token-dropping scheme that operates within a fixed token budget before the Large Language Model (LLM) stage. HiRED can be integrated with existing high-resolution VLMs in a plug-and-play manner, as it requires no additional training while still maintaining superior accuracy. We strategically use the vision encoder's attention in the initial layers to assess the visual content of each image partition and allocate the token budget accordingly. Then, using the attention in the final layer, we select the most important visual tokens from each partition within the allocated budget, dropping the rest. Empirically, when applied to LLaVA-Next-7B on NVIDIA TESLA P40 GPU, HiRED with a 20% token budget increases token generation throughput by 4.7, reduces first-token generation latency by 15 seconds, and saves 2.3 GB of GPU memory for a single inference.

Title: A Web-Based Solution for Federated Learning with LLM-Based Automation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13010
Summary: Federated Learning (FL) offers a promising approach for collaborative machine learning across distributed devices. However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of building reliable communication architectures and the need for expertise in both machine learning and network programming. This paper presents a comprehensive solution that simplifies the orchestration of FL tasks while integrating intent-based automation. We develop a user-friendly web application supporting the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm, enabling users to configure parameters through an intuitive interface. The backend solution efficiently manages communication between the parameter server and edge nodes. We also implement model compression and scheduling algorithms to optimize FL performance. Furthermore, we explore intent-based automation in FL using a fine-tuned Language Model (LLM) trained on a tailored dataset, allowing users to conduct FL tasks using high-level prompts. We observe that the LLM-based automated solution achieves comparable test accuracy to the standard web-based solution while reducing transferred bytes by up to 64% and CPU time by up to 46% for FL tasks. Also, we leverage the neural architecture search (NAS) and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) using LLM to improve the performance. We observe that by using this approach test accuracy can be improved by 10-20% for the carried out FL tasks.

Title: Memory-Efficient LLM Training with Online Subspace Descent
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12857
Summary: Recently, a wide range of memory-efficient LLM training algorithms have gained substantial popularity. These methods leverage the low-rank structure of gradients to project optimizer states into a subspace using projection matrix found by singular value decomposition (SVD). However, convergence of these algorithms is highly dependent on the update rules of their projection matrix. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for arbitrary update rules of projection matrix. This guarantee is generally applicable to optimizers that can be analyzed with Hamiltonian Descent, including most common ones, such as LION, Adam. Inspired by our theoretical understanding, we propose Online Subspace Descent, a new family of subspace descent optimizer without SVD. Instead of updating the projection matrix with eigenvectors, Online Subspace Descent updates the projection matrix with online PCA. Online Subspace Descent is flexible and introduces only minimum overhead to training. We show that for the task of pretraining LLaMA models ranging from 60M to 7B parameters on the C4 dataset, Online Subspace Descent achieves lower perplexity and better downstream tasks performance than state-of-the-art low-rank training methods across different settings and narrows the gap with full-rank baselines.

Title: CODE: Confident Ordinary Differential Editing
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12418
Summary: Conditioning image generation facilitates seamless editing and the creation of photorealistic images. However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution (OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe degradation or OoD inputs.

Title: Multi-Layer Transformers Gradient Can be Approximated in Almost Linear Time
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13233
Summary: The quadratic computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism of popular transformer architectures poses significant challenges for training and inference, particularly in terms of efficiency and memory requirements. Towards addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a novel fast computation method for gradient calculation in multi-layer transformer models. Our approach enables the computation of gradients for the entire multi-layer transformer model in almost linear time n^{1+o(1)}, where n is the input sequence length. This breakthrough significantly reduces the computational bottleneck associated with the traditional quadratic time complexity. Our theory holds for any loss function and maintains a bounded approximation error across the entire model. Furthermore, our analysis can hold when the multi-layer transformer model contains many practical sub-modules, such as residual connection, casual mask, and multi-head attention. By improving the efficiency of gradient computation in large language models, we hope that our work will facilitate the more effective training and deployment of long-context language models based on our theoretical results.

Title: Building and better understanding vision-language models: insights and future directions
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12637
Summary: The field of vision-language models (VLMs), which take images and texts as inputs and output texts, is rapidly evolving and has yet to reach consensus on several key aspects of the development pipeline, including data, architecture, and training methods. This paper can be seen as a tutorial for building a VLM. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each, addressing the major challenges in the field, and suggesting promising research directions for underexplored areas. We then walk through the practical steps to build Idefics3-8B, a powerful VLM that significantly outperforms its predecessor Idefics2-8B, while being trained efficiently, exclusively on open datasets, and using a straightforward pipeline. These steps include the creation of Docmatix, a dataset for improving document understanding capabilities, which is 240 times larger than previously available datasets. We release the model along with the datasets created for its training.

Title: LayerPano3D: Layered 3D Panorama for Hyper-Immersive Scene Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13252
Summary: 3D immersive scene generation is a challenging yet critical task in computer vision and graphics. A desired virtual 3D scene should 1) exhibit omnidirectional view consistency, and 2) allow for free exploration in complex scene hierarchies. Existing methods either rely on successive scene expansion via inpainting or employ panorama representation to represent large FOV scene environments. However, the generated scene suffers from semantic drift during expansion and is unable to handle occlusion among scene hierarchies. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LayerPano3D, a novel framework for full-view, explorable panoramic 3D scene generation from a single text prompt. Our key insight is to decompose a reference 2D panorama into multiple layers at different depth levels, where each layer reveals the unseen space from the reference views via diffusion prior. LayerPano3D comprises multiple dedicated designs: 1) we introduce a novel text-guided anchor view synthesis pipeline for high-quality, consistent panorama generation. 2) We pioneer the Layered 3D Panorama as underlying representation to manage complex scene hierarchies and lift it into 3D Gaussians to splat detailed 360-degree omnidirectional scenes with unconstrained viewing paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates state-of-the-art 3D panoramic scene in both full view consistency and immersive exploratory experience. We believe that LayerPano3D holds promise for advancing 3D panoramic scene creation with numerous applications.

Title: FLoD: Integrating Flexible Level of Detail into 3D Gaussian Splatting for Customizable Rendering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12894
Summary: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves fast and high-quality renderings by using numerous small Gaussians, which leads to significant memory consumption. This reliance on a large number of Gaussians restricts the application of 3DGS-based models on low-cost devices due to memory limitations. However, simply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory capacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved on high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose integrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be rendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While existing 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides reconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory requirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments demonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering quality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different memory constraints. Furthermore, we show that our method generalizes to different 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future state-of-the-art developments.

Title: MME-RealWorld: Could Your Multimodal LLM Challenge High-Resolution Real-World Scenarios that are Difficult for Humans?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13257
Summary: Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than 300K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering 13,366 high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional 25 annotators and 7 experts in MLLMs, contributing to 29,429 question-answer pairs that cover 43 subtasks across 5 real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving 28 prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 60% accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and understanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be addressed. The data and evaluation code are released at https://mme-realworld.github.io/ .

Title: T3M: Text Guided 3D Human Motion Synthesis from Speech
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12885
Summary: Speech-driven 3D motion synthesis seeks to create lifelike animations based on human speech, with potential uses in virtual reality, gaming, and the film production. Existing approaches reply solely on speech audio for motion generation, leading to inaccurate and inflexible synthesis results. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a novel text-guided 3D human motion synthesis method, termed T3M. Unlike traditional approaches, T3M allows precise control over motion synthesis via textual input, enhancing the degree of diversity and user customization. The experiment results demonstrate that T3M can greatly outperform the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations. We have publicly released our code at https://github.com/Gloria2tt/T3M.git{https://github.com/Gloria2tt/T3M.git}
