Title: LightLab: Controlling Light Sources in Images with Diffusion Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09608
Summary: We present a simple, yet effective diffusion-based method for fine-grained, parametric control over light sources in an image. Existing relighting methods either rely on multiple input views to perform inverse rendering at inference time, or fail to provide explicit control over light changes. Our method fine-tunes a diffusion model on a small set of real raw photograph pairs, supplemented by synthetically rendered images at scale, to elicit its photorealistic prior for relighting. We leverage the linearity of light to synthesize image pairs depicting controlled light changes of either a target light source or ambient illumination. Using this data and an appropriate fine-tuning scheme, we train a model for precise illumination changes with explicit control over light intensity and color. Lastly, we show how our method can achieve compelling light editing results, and outperforms existing methods based on user preference.

Title: Understanding and Mitigating Toxicity in Image-Text Pretraining
  Datasets: A Case Study on LLaVA
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06356
Summary: Pretraining datasets are foundational to the development of multimodal models, yet they often have inherent biases and toxic content from the web-scale corpora they are sourced from. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence of toxicity in LLaVA image-text pretraining dataset, examining how harmful content manifests in different modalities. We present a comprehensive analysis of common toxicity categories and propose targeted mitigation strategies, resulting in the creation of a refined toxicity-mitigated dataset. This dataset removes 7,531 of toxic image-text pairs in the LLaVA pre-training dataset. We offer guidelines for implementing robust toxicity detection pipelines. Our findings underscore the need to actively identify and filter toxic content - such as hate speech, explicit imagery, and targeted harassment - to build more responsible and equitable multimodal systems. The toxicity-mitigated dataset is open source and is available for further research.

Title: Behind Maya: Building a Multilingual Vision Language Model
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08910
Summary: In recent times, we have seen a rapid development of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). They have shown impressive results on academic benchmarks, primarily in widely spoken languages but lack performance on low-resource languages and varied cultural contexts. To address these limitations, we introduce Maya, an open-source Multilingual VLM. Our contributions are: 1) a multilingual image-text pretraining dataset in eight languages, based on the LLaVA pretraining dataset; and 2) a multilingual image-text model supporting these languages, enhancing cultural and linguistic comprehension in vision-language tasks.

Title: Steepest Descent Density Control for Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05587
Summary: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time, high-resolution novel view synthesis. By representing scenes as a mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands - posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability.

Title: WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09558
Summary: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 55.1% to 91.5%. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83%. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.

Title: UniSkill: Imitating Human Videos via Cross-Embodiment Skill
  Representations
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08787
Summary: Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

Title: Visually Interpretable Subtask Reasoning for Visual Question Answering
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08084
Summary: Answering complex visual questions like `Which red furniture can be used for sitting?' requires multi-step reasoning, including object recognition, attribute filtering, and relational understanding. Recent work improves interpretability in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by decomposing tasks into sub-task programs, but these methods are computationally expensive and less accurate due to poor adaptation to target data. To address this, we introduce VISTAR (Visually Interpretable Subtask-Aware Reasoning Model), a subtask-driven training framework that enhances both interpretability and reasoning by generating textual and visual explanations within MLLMs. Instead of relying on external models, VISTAR fine-tunes MLLMs to produce structured Subtask-of-Thought rationales (step-by-step reasoning sequences). Experiments on two benchmarks show that VISTAR consistently improves reasoning accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Our code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/ChengJade/VISTAR.

Title: CAST: Component-Aligned 3D Scene Reconstruction from an RGB Image
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12894
Summary: Recovering high-quality 3D scenes from a single RGB image is a challenging task in computer graphics. Current methods often struggle with domain-specific limitations or low-quality object generation. To address these, we propose CAST (Component-Aligned 3D Scene Reconstruction from a Single RGB Image), a novel method for 3D scene reconstruction and recovery. CAST starts by extracting object-level 2D segmentation and relative depth information from the input image, followed by using a GPT-based model to analyze inter-object spatial relationships. This enables the understanding of how objects relate to each other within the scene, ensuring more coherent reconstruction. CAST then employs an occlusion-aware large-scale 3D generation model to independently generate each object's full geometry, using MAE and point cloud conditioning to mitigate the effects of occlusions and partial object information, ensuring accurate alignment with the source image's geometry and texture. To align each object with the scene, the alignment generation model computes the necessary transformations, allowing the generated meshes to be accurately placed and integrated into the scene's point cloud. Finally, CAST incorporates a physics-aware correction step that leverages a fine-grained relation graph to generate a constraint graph. This graph guides the optimization of object poses, ensuring physical consistency and spatial coherence. By utilizing Signed Distance Fields (SDF), the model effectively addresses issues such as occlusions, object penetration, and floating objects, ensuring that the generated scene accurately reflects real-world physical interactions. CAST can be leveraged in robotics, enabling efficient real-to-simulation workflows and providing realistic, scalable simulation environments for robotic systems.

Title: DetReIDX: A Stress-Test Dataset for Real-World UAV-Based Person
  Recognition
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04793
Summary: Person reidentification (ReID) technology has been considered to perform relatively well under controlled, ground-level conditions, but it breaks down when deployed in challenging real-world settings. Evidently, this is due to extreme data variability factors such as resolution, viewpoint changes, scale variations, occlusions, and appearance shifts from clothing or session drifts. Moreover, the publicly available data sets do not realistically incorporate such kinds and magnitudes of variability, which limits the progress of this technology. This paper introduces DetReIDX, a large-scale aerial-ground person dataset, that was explicitly designed as a stress test to ReID under real-world conditions. DetReIDX is a multi-session set that includes over 13 million bounding boxes from 509 identities, collected in seven university campuses from three continents, with drone altitudes between 5.8 and 120 meters. More important, as a key novelty, DetReIDX subjects were recorded in (at least) two sessions on different days, with changes in clothing, daylight and location, making it suitable to actually evaluate long-term person ReID. Plus, data were annotated from 16 soft biometric attributes and multitask labels for detection, tracking, ReID, and action recognition. In order to provide empirical evidence of DetReIDX usefulness, we considered the specific tasks of human detection and ReID, where SOTA methods catastrophically degrade performance (up to 80% in detection accuracy and over 70% in Rank-1 ReID) when exposed to DetReIDXs conditions. The dataset, annotations, and official evaluation protocols are publicly available at https://www.it.ubi.pt/DetReIDX/

Title: Omni-R1: Do You Really Need Audio to Fine-Tune Your Audio LLM?
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09439
Summary: We propose Omni-R1 which fine-tunes a recent multi-modal LLM, Qwen2.5-Omni, on an audio question answering dataset with the reinforcement learning method GRPO. This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU benchmark. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.

Title: SweRank: Software Issue Localization with Code Ranking
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07849
Summary: Software issue localization, the task of identifying the precise code locations (files, classes, or functions) relevant to a natural language issue description (e.g., bug report, feature request), is a critical yet time-consuming aspect of software development. While recent LLM-based agentic approaches demonstrate promise, they often incur significant latency and cost due to complex multi-step reasoning and relying on closed-source LLMs. Alternatively, traditional code ranking models, typically optimized for query-to-code or code-to-code retrieval, struggle with the verbose and failure-descriptive nature of issue localization queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce SweRank, an efficient and effective retrieve-and-rerank framework for software issue localization. To facilitate training, we construct SweLoc, a large-scale dataset curated from public GitHub repositories, featuring real-world issue descriptions paired with corresponding code modifications. Empirical results on SWE-Bench-Lite and LocBench show that SweRank achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both prior ranking models and costly agent-based systems using closed-source LLMs like Claude-3.5. Further, we demonstrate SweLoc's utility in enhancing various existing retriever and reranker models for issue localization, establishing the dataset as a valuable resource for the community.

Title: Marigold: Affordable Adaptation of Diffusion-Based Image Generators for
  Image Analysis
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09358
Summary: The success of deep learning in computer vision over the past decade has hinged on large labeled datasets and strong pretrained models. In data-scarce settings, the quality of these pretrained models becomes crucial for effective transfer learning. Image classification and self-supervised learning have traditionally been the primary methods for pretraining CNNs and transformer-based architectures. Recently, the rise of text-to-image generative models, particularly those using denoising diffusion in a latent space, has introduced a new class of foundational models trained on massive, captioned image datasets. These models' ability to generate realistic images of unseen content suggests they possess a deep understanding of the visual world. In this work, we present Marigold, a family of conditional generative models and a fine-tuning protocol that extracts the knowledge from pretrained latent diffusion models like Stable Diffusion and adapts them for dense image analysis tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normals prediction, and intrinsic decomposition. Marigold requires minimal modification of the pre-trained latent diffusion model's architecture, trains with small synthetic datasets on a single GPU over a few days, and demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization.

Title: DeCLIP: Decoupled Learning for Open-Vocabulary Dense Perception
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04410
Summary: Dense visual prediction tasks have been constrained by their reliance on predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to dense prediction often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features respectively. The ``content'' features are aligned with image crop representations to improve local discriminability, while ``context'' features learn to retain the spatial correlations under the guidance of vision foundation models, such as DINO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks, including object detection and semantic segmentation. Code is available at magenta{https://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP}.

Title: Insights into DeepSeek-V3: Scaling Challenges and Reflections on
  Hardware for AI Architectures
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343
Summary: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has unveiled critical limitations in current hardware architectures, including constraints in memory capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnection bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3, trained on 2,048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, demonstrates how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address these challenges, enabling cost-efficient training and inference at scale. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek-V3/R1 model architecture and its AI infrastructure, highlighting key innovations such as Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for enhanced memory efficiency, Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures for optimized computation-communication trade-offs, FP8 mixed-precision training to unlock the full potential of hardware capabilities, and a Multi-Plane Network Topology to minimize cluster-level network overhead. Building on the hardware bottlenecks encountered during DeepSeek-V3's development, we engage in a broader discussion with academic and industry peers on potential future hardware directions, including precise low-precision computation units, scale-up and scale-out convergence, and innovations in low-latency communication fabrics. These insights underscore the critical role of hardware and model co-design in meeting the escalating demands of AI workloads, offering a practical blueprint for innovation in next-generation AI systems.

Title: VCRBench: Exploring Long-form Causal Reasoning Capabilities of Large
  Video Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08455
Summary: Despite recent advances in video understanding, the capabilities of Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) to perform video-based causal reasoning remains underexplored, largely due to the absence of relevant and dedicated benchmarks for evaluating causal reasoning in visually grounded and goal-driven settings. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark named Video-based long-form Causal Reasoning (VCRBench). We create VCRBench using procedural videos of simple everyday activities, where the steps are deliberately shuffled with each clip capturing a key causal event, to test whether LVLMs can identify, reason about, and correctly sequence the events needed to accomplish a specific goal. Moreover, the benchmark is carefully designed to prevent LVLMs from exploiting linguistic shortcuts, as seen in multiple-choice or binary QA formats, while also avoiding the challenges associated with evaluating open-ended QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs on VCRBench suggests that these models struggle with video-based long-form causal reasoning, primarily due to their difficulty in modeling long-range causal dependencies directly from visual observations. As a simple step toward enabling such capabilities, we propose Recognition-Reasoning Decomposition (RRD), a modular approach that breaks video-based causal reasoning into two sub-tasks of video recognition and causal reasoning. Our experiments on VCRBench show that RRD significantly boosts accuracy on VCRBench, with gains of up to 25.2%. Finally, our thorough analysis reveals interesting insights, for instance, that LVLMs primarily rely on language knowledge for complex video-based long-form causal reasoning tasks.

Title: BLIP3-o: A Family of Fully Open Unified Multimodal Models-Architecture,
  Training and Dataset
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09568
Summary: Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.

Title: Tests as Prompt: A Test-Driven-Development Benchmark for LLM Code
  Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09027
Summary: We introduce WebApp1K, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in test-driven development (TDD) tasks, where test cases serve as both prompt and verification for code generation. Unlike traditional approaches relying on natural language prompts, our benchmark emphasizes the ability of LLMs to interpret and implement functionality directly from test cases, reflecting real-world software development practices. Comprising 1000 diverse challenges across 20 application domains, the benchmark evaluates LLMs on their ability to generate compact, functional code under the constraints of context length and multi-feature complexity. Our findings highlight instruction following and in-context learning as critical capabilities for TDD success, surpassing the importance of general coding proficiency or pretraining knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluation of 19 frontier models, we reveal performance bottlenecks, such as instruction loss in long prompts, and provide a detailed error analysis spanning multiple root causes. This work underscores the practical value of TDD-specific benchmarks and lays the foundation for advancing LLM capabilities in rigorous, application-driven coding scenarios.

Title: Fast Text-to-Audio Generation with Adversarial Post-Training
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08175
Summary: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating approx12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in approx75ms on an H100, and approx7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.

Title: TRAIL: Trace Reasoning and Agentic Issue Localization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08638
Summary: The increasing adoption of agentic workflows across diverse domains brings a critical need to scalably and systematically evaluate the complex traces these systems generate. Current evaluation methods depend on manual, domain-specific human analysis of lengthy workflow traces - an approach that does not scale with the growing complexity and volume of agentic outputs. Error analysis in these settings is further complicated by the interplay of external tool outputs and language model reasoning, making it more challenging than traditional software debugging. In this work, we (1) articulate the need for robust and dynamic evaluation methods for agentic workflow traces, (2) introduce a formal taxonomy of error types encountered in agentic systems, and (3) present a set of 148 large human-annotated traces (TRAIL) constructed using this taxonomy and grounded in established agentic benchmarks. To ensure ecological validity, we curate traces from both single and multi-agent systems, focusing on real-world applications such as software engineering and open-world information retrieval. Our evaluations reveal that modern long context LLMs perform poorly at trace debugging, with the best Gemini-2.5-pro model scoring a mere 11% on TRAIL. Our dataset and code are made publicly available to support and accelerate future research in scalable evaluation for agentic workflows.

Title: Bring Reason to Vision: Understanding Perception and Reasoning through
  Model Merging
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05464
Summary: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine visual perception with the general capabilities, such as reasoning, of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the mechanisms by which these two abilities can be combined and contribute remain poorly understood. In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.

Title: Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08727
Summary: We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM) objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation, we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2 pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation - paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.

Title: Aya Vision: Advancing the Frontier of Multilingual Multimodality
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08751
Summary: Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires aligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction data, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once vision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning, and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling. First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality, diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance. Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.

Title: AM-Thinking-v1: Advancing the Frontier of Reasoning at 32B Scale
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08311
Summary: We present AM-Thinking-v1, a 32B dense language model that advances the frontier of reasoning, embodying the collaborative spirit of open-source innovation. Outperforming DeepSeek-R1 and rivaling leading Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models like Qwen3-235B-A22B and Seed1.5-Thinking, AM-Thinking-v1 achieves impressive scores of 85.3 on AIME 2024, 74.4 on AIME 2025, and 70.3 on LiveCodeBench, showcasing state-of-the-art mathematical and coding capabilities among open-source models of similar scale.   Built entirely from the open-source Qwen2.5-32B base model and publicly available queries, AM-Thinking-v1 leverages a meticulously crafted post-training pipeline - combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning - to deliver exceptional reasoning capabilities. This work demonstrates that the open-source community can achieve high performance at the 32B scale, a practical sweet spot for deployment and fine-tuning. By striking a balance between top-tier performance and real-world usability, we hope AM-Thinking-v1 inspires further collaborative efforts to harness mid-scale models, pushing reasoning boundaries while keeping accessibility at the core of innovation. We have open-sourced our model on https://huggingface.co/a-m-team/AM-Thinking-v1{Hugging Face}.

Title: Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Analysis of Hyperparameter
  Impact on Performance and Efficiency
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08445
Summary: Large language models achieve high task performance yet often hallucinate or rely on outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses these gaps by coupling generation with external search. We analyse how hyperparameters influence speed and quality in RAG systems, covering Chroma and Faiss vector stores, chunking policies, cross-encoder re-ranking, and temperature, and we evaluate six metrics: faithfulness, answer correctness, answer relevancy, context precision, context recall, and answer similarity. Chroma processes queries 13% faster, whereas Faiss yields higher retrieval precision, revealing a clear speed-accuracy trade-off. Naive fixed-length chunking with small windows and minimal overlap outperforms semantic segmentation while remaining the quickest option. Re-ranking provides modest gains in retrieval quality yet increases runtime by roughly a factor of 5, so its usefulness depends on latency constraints. These results help practitioners balance computational cost and accuracy when tuning RAG systems for transparent, up-to-date responses. Finally, we re-evaluate the top configurations with a corrective RAG workflow and show that their advantages persist when the model can iteratively request additional evidence. We obtain a near-perfect context precision (99%), which demonstrates that RAG systems can achieve extremely high retrieval accuracy with the right combination of hyperparameters, with significant implications for applications where retrieval quality directly impacts downstream task performance, such as clinical decision support in healthcare.

Title: Advancing Arabic Reverse Dictionary Systems: A Transformer-Based
  Approach with Dataset Construction Guidelines
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21475
Summary: This study addresses the critical gap in Arabic natural language processing by developing an effective Arabic Reverse Dictionary (RD) system that enables users to find words based on their descriptions or meanings. We present a novel transformer-based approach with a semi-encoder neural network architecture featuring geometrically decreasing layers that achieves state-of-the-art results for Arabic RD tasks. Our methodology incorporates a comprehensive dataset construction process and establishes formal quality standards for Arabic lexicographic definitions. Experiments with various pre-trained models demonstrate that Arabic-specific models significantly outperform general multilingual embeddings, with ARBERTv2 achieving the best ranking score (0.0644). Additionally, we provide a formal abstraction of the reverse dictionary task that enhances theoretical understanding and develop a modular, extensible Python library (RDTL) with configurable training pipelines. Our analysis of dataset quality reveals important insights for improving Arabic definition construction, leading to eight specific standards for building high-quality reverse dictionary resources. This work contributes significantly to Arabic computational linguistics and provides valuable tools for language learning, academic writing, and professional communication in Arabic.

Title: MiniMax-Speech: Intrinsic Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with a Learnable
  Speaker Encoder
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07916
Summary: We introduce MiniMax-Speech, an autoregressive Transformer-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) model that generates high-quality speech. A key innovation is our learnable speaker encoder, which extracts timbre features from a reference audio without requiring its transcription. This enables MiniMax-Speech to produce highly expressive speech with timbre consistent with the reference in a zero-shot manner, while also supporting one-shot voice cloning with exceptionally high similarity to the reference voice. In addition, the overall quality of the synthesized audio is enhanced through the proposed Flow-VAE. Our model supports 32 languages and demonstrates excellent performance across multiple objective and subjective evaluations metrics. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on objective voice cloning metrics (Word Error Rate and Speaker Similarity) and has secured the top position on the public TTS Arena leaderboard. Another key strength of MiniMax-Speech, granted by the robust and disentangled representations from the speaker encoder, is its extensibility without modifying the base model, enabling various applications such as: arbitrary voice emotion control via LoRA; text to voice (T2V) by synthesizing timbre features directly from text description; and professional voice cloning (PVC) by fine-tuning timbre features with additional data. We encourage readers to visit https://minimax-ai.github.io/tts_tech_report for more examples.

Title: NavDP: Learning Sim-to-Real Navigation Diffusion Policy with Privileged
  Information Guidance
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08712
Summary: Learning navigation in dynamic open-world environments is an important yet challenging skill for robots. Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20times more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\% without hurting its generalization capability.

Title: Measuring General Intelligence with Generated Games
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07215
Summary: We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future modeling work and expansion of our benchmark.

Title: ViMRHP: A Vietnamese Benchmark Dataset for Multimodal Review Helpfulness
  Prediction via Human-AI Collaborative Annotation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07416
Summary: Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction (MRHP) is an essential task in recommender systems, particularly in E-commerce platforms. Determining the helpfulness of user-generated reviews enhances user experience and improves consumer decision-making. However, existing datasets focus predominantly on English and Indonesian, resulting in a lack of linguistic diversity, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. In this paper, we introduce ViMRHP (Vietnamese Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction), a large-scale benchmark dataset for MRHP task in Vietnamese. This dataset covers four domains, including 2K products with 46K reviews. Meanwhile, a large-scale dataset requires considerable time and cost. To optimize the annotation process, we leverage AI to assist annotators in constructing the ViMRHP dataset. With AI assistance, annotation time is reduced (90 to 120 seconds per task down to 20 to 40 seconds per task) while maintaining data quality and lowering overall costs by approximately 65%. However, AI-generated annotations still have limitations in complex annotation tasks, which we further examine through a detailed performance analysis. In our experiment on ViMRHP, we evaluate baseline models on human-verified and AI-generated annotations to assess their quality differences. The ViMRHP dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/trng28/ViMRHP

Title: A Multi-Dimensional Constraint Framework for Evaluating and Improving
  Instruction Following in Large Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07591
Summary: Instruction following evaluates large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate outputs that adhere to user-defined constraints. However, existing benchmarks often rely on templated constraint prompts, which lack the diversity of real-world usage and limit fine-grained performance assessment. To fill this gap, we propose a multi-dimensional constraint framework encompassing three constraint patterns, four constraint categories, and four difficulty levels. Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence. Code and data are available in https://github.com/Junjie-Ye/MulDimIF.

Title: SkillFormer: Unified Multi-View Video Understanding for Proficiency
  Estimation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08665
Summary: Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is a challenging problem with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment.

Title: INTELLECT-2: A Reasoning Model Trained Through Globally Decentralized
  Reinforcement Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07291
Summary: We introduce INTELLECT-2, the first globally distributed reinforcement learning (RL) training run of a 32 billion parameter language model. Unlike traditional centralized training efforts, INTELLECT-2 trains a reasoning model using fully asynchronous RL across a dynamic, heterogeneous swarm of permissionless compute contributors.   To enable a training run with this unique infrastructure, we built various components from scratch: we introduce PRIME-RL, our training framework purpose-built for distributed asynchronous reinforcement learning, based on top of novel components such as TOPLOC, which verifies rollouts from untrusted inference workers, and SHARDCAST, which efficiently broadcasts policy weights from training nodes to inference workers.   Beyond infrastructure components, we propose modifications to the standard GRPO training recipe and data filtering techniques that were crucial to achieve training stability and ensure that our model successfully learned its training objective, thus improving upon QwQ-32B, the state of the art reasoning model in the 32B parameter range.   We open-source INTELLECT-2 along with all of our code and data, hoping to encourage and enable more open research in the field of decentralized training.

Title: LLAMAPIE: Proactive In-Ear Conversation Assistants
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04066
Summary: We introduce LlamaPIE, the first real-time proactive assistant designed to enhance human conversations through discreet, concise guidance delivered via hearable devices. Unlike traditional language models that require explicit user invocation, this assistant operates in the background, anticipating user needs without interrupting conversations. We address several challenges, including determining when to respond, crafting concise responses that enhance conversations, leveraging knowledge of the user for context-aware assistance, and real-time, on-device processing. To achieve this, we construct a semi-synthetic dialogue dataset and propose a two-model pipeline: a small model that decides when to respond and a larger model that generates the response. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in providing helpful, unobtrusive assistance. User studies with our assistant, implemented on Apple Silicon M2 hardware, show a strong preference for the proactive assistant over both a baseline with no assistance and a reactive model, highlighting the potential of LlamaPie to enhance live conversations.

Title: DynamicRAG: Leveraging Outputs of Large Language Model as Feedback for
  Dynamic Reranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07233
Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems combine large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval, making them highly effective for knowledge-intensive tasks. A crucial but often under-explored component of these systems is the reranker, which refines retrieved documents to enhance generation quality and explainability. The challenge of selecting the optimal number of documents (k) remains unsolved: too few may omit critical information, while too many introduce noise and inefficiencies. Although recent studies have explored LLM-based rerankers, they primarily leverage internal model knowledge and overlook the rich supervisory signals that LLMs can provide, such as using response quality as feedback for optimizing reranking decisions. In this paper, we propose DynamicRAG, a novel RAG framework where the reranker dynamically adjusts both the order and number of retrieved documents based on the query. We model the reranker as an agent optimized through reinforcement learning (RL), using rewards derived from LLM output quality. Across seven knowledge-intensive datasets, DynamicRAG demonstrates superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/DynamicRAG

Title: Position: AI Competitions Provide the Gold Standard for Empirical Rigor
  in GenAI Evaluation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00612
Summary: In this position paper, we observe that empirical evaluation in Generative AI is at a crisis point since traditional ML evaluation and benchmarking strategies are insufficient to meet the needs of evaluating modern GenAI models and systems. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\em leakage} and {\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized) resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest their results with according value.

Title: MonetGPT: Solving Puzzles Enhances MLLMs' Image Retouching Skills
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06176
Summary: Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs. Generative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible to users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in unacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional procedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp, Lightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals. Unfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual procedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In this paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to critique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them with a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate that MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing operations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles. Subsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit sequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we synthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits and then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize reasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by construction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and resolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a variety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and identity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural alternatives. Code, data, models, and supplementary results can be found via our project website at https://monetgpt.github.io.

Title: Skywork-VL Reward: An Effective Reward Model for Multimodal
  Understanding and Reasoning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07263
Summary: We propose Skywork-VL Reward, a multimodal reward model that provides reward signals for both multimodal understanding and reasoning tasks. Our technical approach comprises two key components: First, we construct a large-scale multimodal preference dataset that covers a wide range of tasks and scenarios, with responses collected from both standard vision-language models (VLMs) and advanced VLM reasoners. Second, we design a reward model architecture based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrating a reward head and applying multi-stage fine-tuning using pairwise ranking loss on pairwise preference data. Experimental evaluations show that Skywork-VL Reward achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal VL-RewardBench and exhibits competitive performance on the text-only RewardBench benchmark. Furthermore, preference data constructed based on our Skywork-VL Reward proves highly effective for training Mixed Preference Optimization (MPO), leading to significant improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Our results underscore Skywork-VL Reward as a significant advancement toward general-purpose, reliable reward models for multimodal alignment. Our model has been publicly released to promote transparency and reproducibility.

Title: Continuous Visual Autoregressive Generation via Score Maximization
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07812
Summary: Conventional wisdom suggests that autoregressive models are used to process discrete data. When applied to continuous modalities such as visual data, Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) typically resorts to quantization-based approaches to cast the data into a discrete space, which can introduce significant information loss. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Continuous VAR framework that enables direct visual autoregressive generation without vector quantization. The underlying theoretical foundation is strictly proper scoring rules, which provide powerful statistical tools capable of evaluating how well a generative model approximates the true distribution. Within this framework, all we need is to select a strictly proper score and set it as the training objective to optimize. We primarily explore a class of training objectives based on the energy score, which is likelihood-free and thus overcomes the difficulty of making probabilistic predictions in the continuous space. Previous efforts on continuous autoregressive generation, such as GIVT and diffusion loss, can also be derived from our framework using other strictly proper scores.

Title: UMoE: Unifying Attention and FFN with Shared Experts
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07260
Summary: Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach for scaling Transformer models. While initial works primarily incorporated MoE into feed-forward network (FFN) layers, recent studies have explored extending the MoE paradigm to attention layers to enhance model performance. However, existing attention-based MoE layers require specialized implementations and demonstrate suboptimal performance compared to their FFN-based counterparts. In this paper, we aim to unify the MoE designs in attention and FFN layers by introducing a novel reformulation of the attention mechanism, revealing an underlying FFN-like structure within attention modules. Our proposed architecture, UMoE, achieves superior performance through attention-based MoE layers while enabling efficient parameter sharing between FFN and attention components.

Title: H^{3}DP: Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy for Visuomotor
  Learning
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07819
Summary: Visuomotor policy learning has witnessed substantial progress in robotic manipulation, with recent approaches predominantly relying on generative models to model the action distribution. However, these methods often overlook the critical coupling between visual perception and action prediction. In this work, we introduce Triply-Hierarchical Diffusion Policy~(H^{\mathbf{3}DP}), a novel visuomotor learning framework that explicitly incorporates hierarchical structures to strengthen the integration between visual features and action generation. H^{3}DP contains 3 levels of hierarchy: (1) depth-aware input layering that organizes RGB-D observations based on depth information; (2) multi-scale visual representations that encode semantic features at varying levels of granularity; and (3) a hierarchically conditioned diffusion process that aligns the generation of coarse-to-fine actions with corresponding visual features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H^{3}DP yields a +27.5% average relative improvement over baselines across 44 simulation tasks and achieves superior performance in 4 challenging bimanual real-world manipulation tasks.

Title: Physics-Assisted and Topology-Informed Deep Learning for Weather
  Prediction
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04918
Summary: Although deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable potential in weather prediction, most of them overlook either the physics of the underlying weather evolution or the topology of the Earth's surface. In light of these disadvantages, we develop PASSAT, a novel Physics-ASSisted And Topology-informed deep learning model for weather prediction. PASSAT attributes the weather evolution to two key factors: (i) the advection process that can be characterized by the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation; (ii) the Earth-atmosphere interaction that is difficult to both model and calculate. PASSAT also takes the topology of the Earth's surface into consideration, other than simply treating it as a plane. With these considerations, PASSAT numerically solves the advection equation and the Navier-Stokes equation on the spherical manifold, utilizes a spherical graph neural network to capture the Earth-atmosphere interaction, and generates the initial velocity fields that are critical to solving the advection equation from the same spherical graph neural network. In the 5.625^circ-resolution ERA5 data set, PASSAT outperforms both the state-of-the-art deep learning-based weather prediction models and the operational numerical weather prediction model IFS T42. Code and checkpoint are available at https://github.com/Yumenomae/PASSAT_5p625.

Title: Overflow Prevention Enhances Long-Context Recurrent LLMs
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07793
Summary: A recent trend in LLMs is developing recurrent sub-quadratic models that improve long-context processing efficiency. We investigate leading large long-context models, focusing on how their fixed-size recurrent memory affects their performance. Our experiments reveal that, even when these models are trained for extended contexts, their use of long contexts remains underutilized. Specifically, we demonstrate that a chunk-based inference procedure, which identifies and processes only the most relevant portion of the input can mitigate recurrent memory failures and be effective for many long-context tasks: On LongBench, our method improves the overall performance of Falcon3-Mamba-Inst-7B by 14%, Falcon-Mamba-Inst-7B by 28%, RecurrentGemma-IT-9B by 50%, and RWKV6-Finch-7B by 51%. Surprisingly, this simple approach also leads to state-of-the-art results in the challenging LongBench v2 benchmark, showing competitive performance with equivalent size Transformers. Furthermore, our findings raise questions about whether recurrent models genuinely exploit long-range dependencies, as our single-chunk strategy delivers stronger performance - even in tasks that presumably require cross-context relations.

Title: AttentionInfluence: Adopting Attention Head Influence for Weak-to-Strong
  Pretraining Data Selection
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07293
Summary: Recently, there has been growing interest in collecting reasoning-intensive pretraining data to improve LLMs' complex reasoning ability. Prior approaches typically rely on supervised classifiers to identify such data, which requires labeling by humans or LLMs, often introducing domain-specific biases. Due to the attention heads being crucial to in-context reasoning, we propose AttentionInfluence, a simple yet effective, training-free method without supervision signal. Our approach enables a small pretrained language model to act as a strong data selector through a simple attention head masking operation. Specifically, we identify retrieval heads and compute the loss difference when masking these heads. We apply AttentionInfluence to a 1.3B-parameter dense model to conduct data selection on the SmolLM corpus of 241B tokens, and mix the SmolLM corpus with the selected subset comprising 73B tokens to pretrain a 7B-parameter dense model using 1T training tokens and WSD learning rate scheduling. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements, ranging from 1.4pp to 3.5pp, across several knowledge-intensive and reasoning-heavy benchmarks (i.e., MMLU, MMLU-Pro, AGIEval-en, GSM8K, and HumanEval). This demonstrates an effective weak-to-strong scaling property, with small models improving the final performance of larger models-offering a promising and scalable path for reasoning-centric data selection.

Title: Unified Continuous Generative Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07447
Summary: Recent advances in continuous generative models, including multi-step approaches like diffusion and flow-matching (typically requiring 8-1000 sampling steps) and few-step methods such as consistency models (typically 1-8 steps), have demonstrated impressive generative performance. However, existing work often treats these approaches as distinct paradigms, resulting in separate training and sampling methodologies. We introduce a unified framework for training, sampling, and analyzing these models. Our implementation, the Unified Continuous Generative Models Trainer and Sampler (UCGM-{T,S}), achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256 using a 675M diffusion transformer, UCGM-T trains a multi-step model achieving 1.30 FID in 20 steps and a few-step model reaching 1.42 FID in just 2 steps. Additionally, applying UCGM-S to a pre-trained model (previously 1.26 FID at 250 steps) improves performance to 1.06 FID in only 40 steps. Code is available at: https://github.com/LINs-lab/UCGM.

Title: Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching for Controllable
  Biological Sequence Design
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07086
Summary: Designing biological sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, functional and biophysical criteria remains a central challenge in biomolecule engineering. While discrete flow matching models have recently shown promise for efficient sampling in high-dimensional sequence spaces, existing approaches address only single objectives or require continuous embeddings that can distort discrete distributions. We present Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Flow Matching (MOG-DFM), a general framework to steer any pretrained discrete-time flow matching generator toward Pareto-efficient trade-offs across multiple scalar objectives. At each sampling step, MOG-DFM computes a hybrid rank-directional score for candidate transitions and applies an adaptive hypercone filter to enforce consistent multi-objective progression. We also trained two unconditional discrete flow matching models, PepDFM for diverse peptide generation and EnhancerDFM for functional enhancer DNA generation, as base generation models for MOG-DFM. We demonstrate MOG-DFM's effectiveness in generating peptide binders optimized across five properties (hemolysis, non-fouling, solubility, half-life, and binding affinity), and in designing DNA sequences with specific enhancer classes and DNA shapes. In total, MOG-DFM proves to be a powerful tool for multi-property-guided biomolecule sequence design.

Title: Document Attribution: Examining Citation Relationships using Large
  Language Models
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06324
Summary: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to document-based tasks - such as document summarization, question answering, and information extraction - where user requirements focus on retrieving information from provided documents rather than relying on the model's parametric knowledge, ensuring the trustworthiness and interpretability of these systems has become a critical concern. A central approach to addressing this challenge is attribution, which involves tracing the generated outputs back to their source documents. However, since LLMs can produce inaccurate or imprecise responses, it is crucial to assess the reliability of these citations.   To tackle this, our work proposes two techniques. (1) A zero-shot approach that frames attribution as a straightforward textual entailment task. Our method using flan-ul2 demonstrates an improvement of 0.27% and 2.4% over the best baseline of ID and OOD sets of AttributionBench, respectively. (2) We also explore the role of the attention mechanism in enhancing the attribution process. Using a smaller LLM, flan-t5-small, the F1 scores outperform the baseline across almost all layers except layer 4 and layers 8 through 11.

Title: Step1X-3D: Towards High-Fidelity and Controllable Generation of Textured
  3D Assets
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07747
Summary: While generative artificial intelligence has advanced significantly across text, image, audio, and video domains, 3D generation remains comparatively underdeveloped due to fundamental challenges such as data scarcity, algorithmic limitations, and ecosystem fragmentation. To this end, we present Step1X-3D, an open framework addressing these challenges through: (1) a rigorous data curation pipeline processing >5M assets to create a 2M high-quality dataset with standardized geometric and textural properties; (2) a two-stage 3D-native architecture combining a hybrid VAE-DiT geometry generator with an diffusion-based texture synthesis module; and (3) the full open-source release of models, training code, and adaptation modules. For geometry generation, the hybrid VAE-DiT component produces TSDF representations by employing perceiver-based latent encoding with sharp edge sampling for detail preservation. The diffusion-based texture synthesis module then ensures cross-view consistency through geometric conditioning and latent-space synchronization. Benchmark results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that exceeds existing open-source methods, while also achieving competitive quality with proprietary solutions. Notably, the framework uniquely bridges the 2D and 3D generation paradigms by supporting direct transfer of 2D control techniques~(e.g., LoRA) to 3D synthesis. By simultaneously advancing data quality, algorithmic fidelity, and reproducibility, Step1X-3D aims to establish new standards for open research in controllable 3D asset generation.

Title: Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning for
  Efficient Adaptive Search Agent
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07596
Summary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a common strategy to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) can enable LLMs to act as search agents by activating retrieval capabilities, existing ones often underutilize their internal knowledge. This can lead to redundant retrievals, potential harmful knowledge conflicts, and increased inference latency. To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.

Title: MiMo: Unlocking the Reasoning Potential of Language Model -- From
  Pretraining to Posttraining
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07608
Summary: We present MiMo-7B, a large language model born for reasoning tasks, with optimization across both pre-training and post-training stages. During pre-training, we enhance the data preprocessing pipeline and employ a three-stage data mixing strategy to strengthen the base model's reasoning potential. MiMo-7B-Base is pre-trained on 25 trillion tokens, with additional Multi-Token Prediction objective for enhanced performance and accelerated inference speed. During post-training, we curate a dataset of 130K verifiable mathematics and programming problems for reinforcement learning, integrating a test-difficulty-driven code-reward scheme to alleviate sparse-reward issues and employing strategic data resampling to stabilize training. Extensive evaluations show that MiMo-7B-Base possesses exceptional reasoning potential, outperforming even much larger 32B models. The final RL-tuned model, MiMo-7B-RL, achieves superior performance on mathematics, code and general reasoning tasks, surpassing the performance of OpenAI o1-mini. The model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/xiaomimimo/MiMo.

Title: DanceGRPO: Unleashing GRPO on Visual Generation
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07818
Summary: Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReel-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.
