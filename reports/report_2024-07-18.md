- *Relevant Paper*: Foundational Autoraters: Taming Large Language Models for Better Automatic Evaluation
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as "autoraters" for evaluating the output of other LLMs. The authors emphasize the importance of using large and diverse datasets of human judgments to train these autoraters, ensuring their ability to generalize to a wide variety of tasks.

- *Relevant Paper*:  Make-An-Agent: A Generalizable Policy Network Generator with Behavior-Prompted Diffusion
    - *Why it's relevant*:  This paper presents a method for generating control policies for AI agents using a small number of demonstrations of desired behaviors. This approach incorporates human input in the form of behavioral examples, which allows the model to learn more efficiently and effectively.

**How to make it easier to explain AI systemâ€™s behavior?**

- *Relevant Paper*: Model Surgery: Modulating LLM's Behavior Via Simple Parameter Editing
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes a method for directly editing a small subset of parameters in LLMs to modify their behavior, such as making them less toxic or more resistant to jailbreak attempts. This approach offers a more transparent and interpretable way to control LLM behavior compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.
