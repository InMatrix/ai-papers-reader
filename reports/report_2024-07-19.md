- *Relevant Paper*:  Make-An-Agent: A Generalizable Policy Network Generator with Behavior-Prompted Diffusion
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces Make-An-Agent, a novel policy parameter generator that leverages conditional diffusion models for behavior-to-policy generation. This means that by providing a single demonstration of desired behaviors, the model can generate a control policy for an agent. This approach is highly efficient, as it only requires few-shot demonstrations as input.
