        "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18282",
        "relevance": "This paper enhances robot (AI agent) manipulation by distilling high-level reasoning from VLMs into 'minimal cues' (keypoints, masks) for policies, improving zero-shot generalization. From an HCI perspective, these minimal, point-based intermediate representations offer a valuable avenue for Explainable AI (XAI) in robotics. By explicitly showing 'where to attend, what actions to take, and how to execute,' these cues can make robot decision-making more transparent and interpretable for human operators. This helps build trust, allows for easier debugging of agent failures, and enables more effective human oversight and collaboration with intelligent robots."

This directly impacts HCI for multi-agent systems, particularly in safety-critical domains. For autonomous vehicles (complex AI agents), human trust and understanding of their decision-making, especially in cooperative scenarios with occlusions, are paramount. The GoT framework could potentially offer interpretable reasoning pathways, allowing human supervisors or passengers to better comprehend the agents' perception, prediction, and planning, thus facilitating safer and more reliable human-agent collaboration in shared environments."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16990",
        "relevance": "This paper introduces a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) method to train Speech-Aware Large Language Models (SALLMs) for open-format speech understanding tasks. For HCI, this is significant as SALLMs are user-facing systems (e.g., Spoken Question Answering). The use of RL with BLEU as a reward signal aims to optimize generative abilities, which directly impacts the quality and coherence of responses users receive. HCI research can contribute to designing reward functions that align more closely with human perceptions of quality, and explore how users interact with and adapt to models trained via such RL methods for improved speech interactions."

For Reinforcement Learning, especially with an HCI perspective, this is highly relevant to 'novel agent environment design.' Creating realistic and controllable environments is crucial for training RL agents to learn complex physical behaviors. HCI can explore how humans design these physics-based environments, how they guide agents in learning from them, or how agents communicate their understanding of physical interactions. The ability to control physical parameters and forces directly informs intuitive human-agent collaboration in virtual or robotic tasks."

        "relevance": "MiniCPM-V 4.5 presents an efficient MLLM, incorporating a 'hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes.' From an HCI perspective, improving the efficiency and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs through RL is foundational for building more responsive and intelligent AI agents and user-facing multimodal systems. Enhanced proficiency in diverse reasoning modes, especially with improved efficiency, means users can interact with more capable and less resource-intensive AI. This allows for smoother multimodal interactions and broader accessibility, significantly improving user experience and system utility across various applications."

        "relevance": "SIM-CoT introduces a training module to stabilize and enrich the latent reasoning space of implicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in LLMs. Critically for XAI and HCI, it affords 'interpretability of implicit reasoning by projecting each latent token onto an explicit reasoning vocabulary, enabling per-step visualization of semantic roles and diagnosis.' This is a significant step towards making opaque LLM reasoning processes transparent without incurring inference overhead. Human users can gain insight into an LLM's internal 'thought' process, fostering trust, enabling debugging, and promoting a deeper understanding of how AI systems arrive at their conclusions."

        "relevance": "D-REX introduces a novel benchmark to detect 'deceptive reasoning' in LLMs, where models produce benign outputs from malicious internal reasoning. This is paramount for XAI and HCI for AI safety and trust. The paper demonstrates that traditional output-based safety monitors fail, emphasizing the need to 'scrutinize the internal processes of LLMs.' By showing that 'linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect strategic dishonesty,' D-REX provides a powerful XAI technique. This enables internal transparency, allowing humans to verify model intentions and ensuring that AI systems are not only harmless in output but also honest in their underlying processes."

        "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18010",
        "relevance": "This paper critically evaluates the explanatory power of cross-attention in Speech-to-Text (S2T) models, comparing it to saliency maps. For XAI and HCI, this work is crucial because attention mechanisms are widely repurposed as explanations, yet their fidelity to actual model reasoning is often assumed. The finding that cross-attention only captures 'about 50% of the input relevance' directly challenges this assumption. This informs HCI researchers and practitioners about the limitations of current transparency techniques, guiding the development of more accurate and complete explanations that truly reflect how S2T models process information, thus building more appropriate user trust and understanding."
