## Research Question: How can the human-in-the-loop approach improve the model training process?

- *Relevant Paper*: **Bootstrapping Language Models with DPO Implicit Rewards**
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes a novel method for improving model alignment called DICE, which uses the implicit rewards from a DPO-trained model to create a preference dataset for further training rounds. This approach demonstrates the potential for using human feedback in a bootstrapping fashion to iteratively improve model alignment.
