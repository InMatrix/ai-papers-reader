title: Unpacking the Black Box&#58; New Research Sheds Light on How Speech Recognition
  Models Work
---



**San Francisco, CA – August 21, 2025** – For years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have become increasingly sophisticated, powering everything from virtual assistants to transcription services. However, the inner workings of these powerful tools have largely remained a mystery, often treated as a complex "black box." Now, a groundbreaking study by researchers at aiOla is beginning to demystify these systems, adapting cutting-edge interpretability techniques from large language models (LLMs) to peek inside the processes that transform spoken words into text.

The paper, titled "Beyond Transcription: Mechanistic Interpretability in ASR," details how the team applied methods like "logit lens," "linear probing," and "activation patching" to analyze the internal dynamics of popular ASR models, including Whisper and Qwen2-Audio. The goal was to understand how acoustic and semantic information is processed across different layers of these models and to identify the root causes of common errors like repetitive speech or "hallucinations" (generating text that wasn't spoken).

One of the study's key findings is that even within the encoder layers, which are primarily responsible for processing raw audio, models are already developing an understanding of semantic meaning. For instance, the researchers found that specific encoder layers could accurately predict semantic categories, such as distinguishing between "fruits" and "clothing," with impressive accuracy. This suggests a more integrated approach to processing language than previously assumed, where the encoder isn't just a sound processor but also begins to grasp meaning.

"We discovered that the encoder isn't just processing acoustic input; it's also encoding contextual expectations that can bias the model towards more likely completions," the paper states. This is exemplified by experiments where disrupting encoder components with white noise actually *improved* acoustic accuracy in some cases, revealing the encoder's hidden reliance on contextual cues.

The research also delves into the decoder's role, particularly in error phenomena. The study found that signals related to speech quality and potential hallucinations are strongly represented in the decoder's "residual stream," a late-stage representation. This insight could pave the way for real-time monitoring of transcription quality.

Furthermore, the paper pinpoints specific mechanisms responsible for repetitive speech errors, often a frustrating glitch in ASR systems. By analyzing attention mechanisms within the decoder, the researchers identified a particular cross-attention component in layer 18 that plays a critical role in suppressing repetitions. In a striking example, they found that targeting just one specific attention "head" within this layer could suppress repetitions in a significant majority of cases. This suggests that highly localized interventions could be a powerful tool for fixing such errors without degrading overall performance.

To illustrate the evolution of predictions, the researchers employed an "Encoder Lens" technique, which involves gradually removing encoder layers and observing how the decoder's output changes. This revealed fascinating patterns, such as models in mid-layers sometimes producing grammatically correct but semantically unrelated text. For example, one observation showed a model outputting "Yes, I need to go to the bathroom" when the original audio content was about a different topic, demonstrating a potential drift towards fluent but nonsensical completions.

In essence, this research offers a crucial first step towards building more transparent and robust ASR systems. By adapting and applying LLM interpretability tools, the study provides concrete insights into how speech is understood and transcribed, opening new avenues for debugging, improving performance, and ultimately building more reliable AI.
