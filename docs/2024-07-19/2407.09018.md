title: AI Agent Automates Mobile App Testing, Detecting Functional Bugs with 94% Accuracy
---



In a significant stride toward automating quality assurance for commercial mobile applications, researchers from Fudan University and the tech giant Meituan have introduced **AUITestAgent**, the first automatic, natural language-driven tool designed to handle the complex, real-world requirements of Graphical User Interface (GUI) function testing.

Modern mobile apps, such as large online platforms spanning multiple business lines (e.g., hotel booking, food delivery), feature thousands of GUI pages and undergo rapid development cycles. Testing engineers traditionally rely on manual methods or hard-coded scripts, which are labor-intensive, costly to maintain, and quickly become obsolete.

AUITestAgent aims to resolve this bottleneck by accepting natural language test requirements—the same format human engineers use—and automatically executing and verifying the app’s functionality.

### Decoupling Interaction and Verification

The core innovation of AUITestAgent lies in its architecture, which employs dynamically organized Large Language Model (LLM) agents and decouples the interaction process from the verification process.

Test requirements vary widely. Some are highly detailed, like, “In the movie show, select the first movie under 'Now Showing' and click the 'Want to Watch' button. Check if the button turns gray and the text changes to 'Wanted'.” For these explicit commands, AUITestAgent uses a streamlined pipeline (Observer, Selector, Executor) to perform the required clicks and inputs step-by-step.

However, other requirements are concise, such as, “Turn on the 'Elderly Mode' of the App, check whether the App returns to the homepage.” For this, the system activates a more sophisticated Planner and Monitor agent pattern, which reasons through the necessary sequence of actions and validates when the user’s intent has been achieved.

### Solving the LLM Verification Problem

While LLMs are increasingly adept at generating interaction commands, verifying functionality poses a challenge due to the sheer volume of data in interaction logs (screenshots, UI hierarchy files, performed actions) and the LLMs’ difficulty performing semantic analysis across multiple complex images.

To ensure high-quality verification, AUITestAgent simplifies the testing task by converting complex natural language test oracles (the verification checks) into a list of simple, single questions called "verification points."

It then employs a multi-dimensional data extraction strategy to efficiently retrieve relevant information from the interaction trace, focusing on three categories: GUI elements (location, properties), GUI pages (type, category), and page state transitions. This structured text input is then used by the Function Verification Module to make a judgment.

In experiments conducted on customized benchmarks, AUITestAgent achieved a verification accuracy of 94%, significantly outperforming existing interaction tools in generating high-quality GUI actions.

### Real-World Bug Detection

The practical efficacy of the tool was demonstrated during a field deployment within Meituan’s video business line. This scenario is highly complex, involving numerous checkpoints related to playback functions and merchant/product interactions.

The deployment showed AUITestAgent saved testing engineers roughly 1.5 Person-Days (PD) in each round of regression testing. More critically, across just 10 rounds of regression testing over two months, the tool successfully detected four new functional bugs.

One such bug involved a complex sequence of swiping and tapping a shop information card. AUITestAgent detected a failure in which the shop details half-screen modal did not display or dismiss correctly, confirming the tool’s ability to handle subtle, real-world functional anomalies in commercial applications.

The researchers conclude that AUITestAgent effectively automates requirements-oriented GUI testing, highlighting the potential of advanced AI agents to manage the substantial testing workload inherent in modern mobile development.
