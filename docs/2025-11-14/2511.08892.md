title: ByteDance Unveils Lumine&#58; The First AI Agent to Master Hours-Long Missions
  in 3D Open Worlds
---



**ByteDance Seed** has announced the development of **Lumine**, a new generalist artificial intelligence agent capable of completing complex, hours-long missions in expansive 3D open-world environments in real time. Lumine, described by the researchers as the "first open recipe" for building such agents, demonstrates human-level efficiency in complex video game environments, successfully navigating, fighting, and problem-solving without needing explicit game APIs.

Lumine was primarily trained using the highly popular open-world action RPG *Genshin Impact* as its testbed. Crucially, the VLM-based (Vision-Language Model) agent interacts with the game exactly like a human player: processing raw screen pixels (1280x720 resolution) and issuing precise keyboard and mouse actions, unifying perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end loop.

The key to Lumine’s success in real-time, dynamic environments is its innovative **hybrid thinking strategy**. Unlike traditional agents that reason at every step—a computationally slow process—Lumine adaptively invokes explicit reasoning, generating an "inner monologue" only when necessary, such as when a plan needs adjusting or a new objective appears. Otherwise, it generates actions directly for efficient, low-latency control.

To achieve fluid performance in a fast-paced environment, Lumine processes visual input at 5 Hz but outputs actions at a high frequency of 30 Hz using a mechanism called "action chunking." This means it generates sequences of precise keyboard presses and relative mouse movements (e.g., turning the camera 92 units right while dashing forward with Shift + W), enabling the complex, continuous control required for 3D navigation and combat.

### Human-Level Performance and Zero-Shot Transfer

The results are striking. Lumine successfully completed the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline in *Genshin Impact* in just 56 minutes, matching the efficiency of expert human players (average expert time is 53 minutes). This achievement spans a broad spectrum of in-game challenges, including 3D exploration, real-time combat, puzzle-solving (like activating elemental mechanisms), and precise GUI manipulation (such as character revival).

Beyond its training domain, Lumine exhibited remarkable zero-shot generalization—the ability to perform tasks in new games without any fine-tuning.

For instance, the agent successfully completed a 100-minute main storyline mission in the entirely different open-world ARPG *Wuthering Waves*. Furthermore, it mastered the full five-hour first chapter of *Honkai: Star Rail*, a turn-based strategy game with a hub-based world design, demonstrating that its core skills—such as 3D navigation and 2D UI manipulation—are widely transferable across distinct genres and interaction dynamics.

The Lumine project, built upon a 7B-parameter VLM and optimized for real-time inference (achieving a 25.3x latency speedup over baseline models), marks a significant step toward general-purpose agents capable of sustained, high-level decision-making in complex digital worlds. Researchers suggest the "recipe" can be scaled further, potentially accelerating applications in quality assurance, game testing, and large-scale usability evaluation.
