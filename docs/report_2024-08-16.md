## Human-in-the-loop machine learning for improved training or evaluation
### Learning Task Decomposition to Assist Humans in Competitive Programming
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper focuses on a human-in-the-loop approach to training LLMs for competitive programming tasks. It introduces the concept of "assistive value" to measure how effectively decomposed solutions can be repaired by humans, leading to more efficient and collaborative problem-solving between humans and AI. This concept could be applied to other domains where AI models need to learn from human feedback and collaborate with users.
