# Large Language Models Need Help, But Current Methods for Guiding Them Are Flawed:  A New Approach Shows Promise

Large language models (LLMs) are powerful tools, but getting them to do what you want requires a good understanding of how to "prompt" them.  This is especially difficult for non-experts who lack the technical knowledge to write effective prompts.  A new paper by Ming Wang et al. proposes a structural design framework for prompts called LangGPT, which allows non-experts to write prompts that are reusable and extensible. They also introduce a tool called Minstrel, a multi-agent system that automatically generates LangGPT prompts, further lowering the barrier to entry for non-experts.

The paper starts by discussing the challenges of prompt engineering for LLMs.  Current methods for optimizing prompts include summarizing design tricks and using automatic optimization methods.  However, these methods are often limited in scope, requiring users to be familiar with specific models and tasks, and they lack generalization and robustness.

The authors argue that a more structured approach is needed for prompt engineering.  They introduce LangGPT, which is based on a modular, dual-layer structure inspired by programming languages.  LangGPT defines two key components: modules and elements. Modules represent perspectives on the content, while elements provide specific content within each module.

LangGPT provides a systematic and reusable framework for prompt design.  This structure allows users to design prompts that can be generalized and reused for various tasks.  However, creating these LangGPT prompts can still be challenging for non-experts.  To address this, the authors introduce Minstrel, a multi-agent system that automates the generation of LangGPT prompts.

Minstrel uses a collaborative approach, employing three working groups:  analysis, design, and test. The analysis group analyzes user requirements and identifies relevant LangGPT modules. The design group then generates content for each module, and the test group evaluates the effectiveness of the prompt through systematic testing using an LLM-based reflector agent.

The paper provides experimental results comparing the performance of LLMs using different prompt designs, including hand-designed LangGPT prompts, Minstrel-generated LangGPT prompts, and baseline prompts. The results show that LangGPT prompts significantly outperform the baseline prompts in guiding LLMs for various tasks.  Additionally, the paper includes a user survey that demonstrates the ease of use and user satisfaction with LangGPT.

The paper concludes that LangGPT and Minstrel offer a promising new approach to prompt engineering, making LLMs more accessible and effective for non-experts.  This research suggests that structured approaches to prompt design can significantly improve the performance of LLMs and reduce the learning cost for non-experts.  The authors believe that this research will help to make LLMs more readily accessible and usable for a wider range of users.
