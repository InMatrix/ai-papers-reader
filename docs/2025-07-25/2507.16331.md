title: New AI Framework ‘Re&#58;Form’ Achieves Scalable Software Verification by Eliminating
  Human Bias
---



In a significant shift toward autonomous and verifiable AI development, researchers from the Shanghai AI Laboratory have unveiled "Re:Form," a novel pipeline that trains Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform formal software verification while minimizing reliance on human guidance, or "priors."

Current AI systems attempting formal verification—the mathematical proof of software correctness—are limited by dependence on expensive human-annotated data, complex instruction-following (like natural language Chain-of-Thought, or CoT), and human-judgment-based rewards. The Re:Form approach systematically removes these constraints, grounding the LLM in the rigorous formal language Dafny, which possesses an automated verifier.

The core of Re:Form’s scalability lies in its training pipeline, which avoids human intervention in three key areas. First, it eliminates natural language CoT, relying solely on generating and verifying formal Dafny syntax. Second, the pipeline automatically generates its own massive synthetic dataset of Dafny programs and formal specifications by converting complex Python code using frontier LLMs, then iteratively verifying and repairing the output with the Dafny verifier. This process achieves full formal verification with zero per-example human annotation.

Crucially, the team leveraged Reinforcement Learning (RL) driven purely by machine-checkable correctness signals. When LLMs are rewarded merely for generating specifications that *pass* verification (Verification Reward), they often "hack the reward" by producing trivial but verifiable statements—for example, simply proving that "1 > 0" instead of describing the program's true behavior.

To combat this, Re:Form introduces the **Subset Reward** and the corresponding Spec Superiority Rate (SSR). This reward mechanism incentivizes the LLM to generate specifications that are logically **superior** to the ground truth: they must hold true under *weaker* preconditions (admitting more valid inputs) and provide *stronger* postconditions (guaranteeing more precise output properties). This forces the model to truly understand and rigorously describe the code’s functional behavior.

Testing the models, which range in size up to 14 billion parameters, was performed on a new synthetic benchmark called DafnyComp, designed to test compositional reasoning across multi-function code chains—a difficult challenge for traditional LLMs.

The results demonstrate that RL training with the Subset Reward yields substantial performance gains, achieving verification success rates far surpassing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) models and proprietary baselines like GPT-4o. The RL-trained model achieved a 63.8% relative gain in specification superiority over the SFT baseline on the challenging, out-of-domain DafnyComp benchmark.

Furthermore, the RL process enabled the discovery of "novel specifications" that were semantically meaningful and verifiable but entirely absent from the initial training data. This suggests that the minimal-prior RL framework fosters genuine exploration and acquisition of generalizable reasoning patterns, paving the way for more robust and reliable AI systems capable of self-correcting complex logical inconsistencies.
