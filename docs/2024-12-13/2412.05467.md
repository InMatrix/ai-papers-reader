title: BrowserGym&#58; A New Ecosystem for Evaluating Web Agents Powered by LLMs
---



A team of researchers from ServiceNow, Mila, and Polytechnique Montréal has introduced BrowserGym, a novel ecosystem designed to streamline the evaluation and benchmarking of web agents, particularly those leveraging large language models (LLMs).  Their findings, published in a recent preprint, address a critical gap in the field: the lack of a standardized and unified approach to comparing the performance of these increasingly sophisticated AI systems.

Currently, the landscape of web agent benchmarks is fragmented.  Numerous benchmarks exist, each with its unique evaluation methodology, making direct comparison of different agents and LLMs challenging. BrowserGym aims to rectify this by providing a standardized, gym-like environment – familiar to reinforcement learning researchers – with clearly defined observation and action spaces. This allows for consistent evaluation across diverse benchmarks.

**Concrete Example:** Imagine two research teams developing web agents designed to automate online shopping. One uses benchmark A, which measures success based on cart creation, while the other uses benchmark B, focused on purchase completion.  Without standardization, comparing the effectiveness of these agents is difficult. BrowserGym provides a common platform allowing both teams to evaluate their agents against a standardized set of tasks (including ones similar to cart creation and purchase completion), enabling direct comparison and more reliable conclusions about performance.

BrowserGym is coupled with AgentLab, a complementary framework that simplifies agent creation, testing, and analysis.  AgentLab offers features such as parallel experiment execution, a visual tool (AgentXRay) for inspecting agent behavior, and readily available building blocks to accelerate the development process.

**AgentLab in Action:** A researcher wants to test six different LLMs on multiple web agent benchmarks.  Using AgentLab, they can easily set up parallel experiments, automatically running each LLM on each benchmark concurrently. AgentXRay allows them to visually analyze each agent’s actions, decisions, and interactions on a per-step basis.

The paper includes the results of the first large-scale multi-benchmark web agent experiment conducted using BrowserGym and AgentLab. Six state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Llama 3.1 variants) were compared across various benchmarks.

**Key Findings:** Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperformed other models on most benchmarks, achieving a remarkable 39.1% success rate on the complex WorkArena L2 benchmark (compared to 8.5% for GPT-4). However, GPT-4 excelled on vision-related tasks.  This highlights both the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in handling the complexities of real-world web interactions.

The researchers emphasize that building robust and efficient web agents remains a significant challenge, citing the inherent complexities of web environments and the limitations of current models. Future work will focus on refining benchmarks, improving agent safety and reproducibility, and developing more efficient and robust LLMs.

BrowserGym and AgentLab offer a significant advance in web agent research by providing a unified and extensible ecosystem for both evaluating existing agents and creating new benchmarks. This standardization, coupled with AgentLab’s tools, promises to accelerate innovation in this rapidly evolving field and foster more robust and reliable comparisons of LLM-powered web agents.  The project's open-source nature further encourages community contribution and wider adoption, potentially leading to significant advancements in the near future.
