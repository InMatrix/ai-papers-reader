title: Standardizing Turkish AI&#58; New TrGLUE Benchmark Sets Rigorous Bar for Language
  Models
---



In a crucial step toward closing the linguistic resource gap, researchers have introduced TrGLUE and SentiTurca, the first comprehensive and standardized benchmarks for evaluating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and sentiment analysis in Turkish. These benchmarks aim to provide a robust, native-first evaluation suite comparable to the widely used GLUE benchmark for English.

While global benchmarks like GLUE and its counterparts for Chinese or French have long existed, Turkish NLU research has relied on fragmented datasets or low-quality translations. This approach often fails, as the agglutinative and morphologically rich nature of Turkish—where one word can carry the meaning of several English words—renders literal translations unnatural and invalidates core semantic tasks.

To overcome this, the creators built TrGLUE using an innovative semi-automated annotation pipeline, relying primarily on Turkish-native texts sourced from licensed news outlets, social platforms, and Wikipedia. The pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate preliminary labels, which are then rigorously vetted by expert human annotators through a disagreement-driven triage process. This ensures both scalability and high linguistic quality, minimizing translation artifacts and preserving Turkish's unique syntactic naturalness.

TrGLUE covers the full range of General Language Understanding tasks, including textual acceptability (TrCoLA), semantic similarity (TrSTS-B), and natural language inference (TrMNLI).

### Intuition: The Challenge of Turkish Grammar

The core challenge TrGLUE addresses is Turkish’s structural complexity. For instance, in the task of paraphrase detection (TrMRPC), the models must account for *agglutination*—the process where suffixes are stacked onto a word stem.

Instead of filtering sentences based on matching surface words, the TrGLUE pipeline uses **lemmas** (root words) to determine similarity. If a Turkish sentence about a soccer game uses "attı" (he/she threw) and a supposedly paraphrased sentence uses "atıyorlardı" (they were throwing), a simple word check would fail. By prioritizing lemma checks, the system correctly identifies that both sentences concern the verb *atmak* (to throw), allowing the model to focus on true semantic equivalence rather than minor morphological variations.

### Specialized Focus: SentiTurca and Hate Speech

In parallel, the researchers introduced SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis encompassing movie reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and the extensive **Turkish Hate Map (TuHaMa)**.

The TuHaMa dataset is a significant resource, comprising 52,000 entries across 13 sensitive categories, including misogyny, political conflict, and refugee sentiment. The texts, drawn from real-world conversational contexts, often contain subtle expressions of "polite hate" or use cultural references that are nearly impossible for systems trained only on surface-level profanity to detect.

Initial evaluations using the Turkish model BERTurk and leading global LLMs on TrGLUE revealed significant performance differences. For the TrCoLA grammatical acceptability task, several renowned proprietary models struggled to differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable sentences, failing to grasp fundamental rules of Turkish morphology. This outcome highlights TrGLUE's effectiveness in exposing genuine linguistic weaknesses in current AI systems, underscoring the necessity of using benchmarks tailored to the language's unique characteristics.

The new benchmarks, including all data, fine-tuning scripts, and detailed documentation, have been released open-source on Hugging Face and GitHub to facilitate rapid development and standardized testing in the Turkish NLP community.
