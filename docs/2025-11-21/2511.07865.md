title: LLM-Powered Chaos Engineering System Cuts Resilience Testing Costs to Under
  a Dollar
---



An international team of researchers has unveiled ChaosEater, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based system capable of fully automating the entire cycle of Chaos Engineering (CE). The development promises to drastically reduce the time and cost required to build resilient distributed software systems, making sophisticated resilience testing accessible to a much broader audience.

Chaos Engineering is a proactive technique that involves intentionally injecting faults into a system—such as simulating network latency or crashing a server—to expose weaknesses before they cause catastrophic production failures. While modern tools automate the *execution* of these experiments, the labor-intensive planning, hypothesis generation, result analysis, and subsequent system reconfiguration have remained manual processes requiring deep, multi-domain expertise.

Daisuke Kikuta and colleagues at NTT, Inc. addressed this bottleneck by creating ChaosEater, which employs a collaborative network of LLM agents to handle these complex, manual tasks across the entire CE workflow: Hypothesis, Experiment, Analysis, and Improvement. Targeting systems built on Kubernetes (K8s), the LLM agents perform software engineering tasks like requirement definition, code generation, and debugging autonomously.

The system’s core innovation lies in its structured agentic workflow and its use of Validation as Code (VaC). When defining a steady state—the expected normal behavior of a system—ChaosEater doesn't rely on abstract definitions. Instead, the LLM generates executable unit tests (VaC scripts) in Python or Javascript that assert specific metrics must be maintained, even when faults are injected. For example, if a team hypothesizes that their service is resilient to a specific fault, the LLM might write a VaC script asserting that the "pod count must remain consistent" or the "95th percentile request latency must stay below 500ms."

If the hypothesis fails during the experiment phase, ChaosEater's LLM agents analyze the failed VaC logs and the fault injection timeline to identify the root cause. Crucially, the system then enters the Improvement phase, where an agent automatically reconfigures the K8s manifests (configuration files) to satisfy the hypothesis.

The team evaluated ChaosEater using case studies on both small and large-scale K8s systems, including a minimal NGINX deployment and the multi-service SockShop e-commerce application. The results demonstrate remarkable efficiency and stability.

For the NGINX system, which was intentionally configured to be non-resilient (if a pod failed, it wouldn't restart), ChaosEater successfully completed a full CE cycle, including identifying the issue and reconfiguring the system for resilience, with an average monetary cost of just **$0.21** and a time commitment of **11 minutes**.

The larger SockShop system, featuring 29 manifests, cost only **$0.84** and required **25 minutes** per cycle. In this scenario, ChaosEater successfully identified that running deployments with a single replica was a weakness, and it automatically reconfigured the K8s manifests to increase the replica count, significantly boosting resilience.

Qualitative validation by human engineers and separate LLM models confirmed that ChaosEater consistently delivered reasonable and valid CE cycles. While currently limited to reconfiguring K8s manifests, the breakthrough suggests a future where automated systems can continuously test and improve the resilience of modern software, democratizing a specialized field that was once prohibitive due to complexity and cost.
