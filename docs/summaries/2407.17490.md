## AMEX: A New Dataset for Mobile GUI Agents

The advancement of AI agents in mobile scenarios is crucial for enhancing user experiences and expanding their capabilities beyond system-built applications. To facilitate research in this field, a new dataset, **AMEX (Android Multi-annotation Expo)**, has been introduced, offering a comprehensive and large-scale collection of data specifically designed for training and evaluating generalist mobile GUI-control agents. 

**AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from 110 popular mobile applications, annotated at three levels:**

1. **GUI interactive element grounding:** This level provides bounding boxes for all clickable and scrollable elements, defining the interactive elements users can interact with. 
2. **GUI screen and element functionality descriptions:**  AMEX goes beyond simple element classification, offering descriptions of each element's functionality within its context and detailed descriptions of the entire screen's purpose. 
3. **Complex natural language instructions:** Each instruction includes an average of 13 steps, outlining a complex chain of actions that need to be performed on the mobile device to achieve a specific goal. These instructions are more realistic and challenging than those found in other datasets, demanding a deeper understanding of the task and app functionalities.

**AMEX Addresses the Limitations of Existing Datasets:**

Previous datasets for mobile GUI-control agents have been limited in their comprehensiveness and the level of detail provided. They often lack accurate annotations, focus on system-built apps, or use overly simplistic instructions. AMEX addresses these issues by:

* **Offering a larger dataset with diverse and challenging instructions**: AMEX includes 3,000 unique instructions for general third-party apps, each with an average of 13 steps, covering a wide range of scenarios and app functionalities.
* **Providing more detailed and accurate annotations**: The multi-level annotation scheme ensures the dataset is truly instructive and provides a more nuanced understanding of the UI elements and their functionalities.
* **Focusing on third-party applications**: AMEX focuses on a more realistic scenario by providing data on general third-party applications, reflecting the real-world usage of mobile devices.

**AMEX Helps to Advance Research on Mobile GUI-Control Agents:**

AMEX is designed to push the boundaries of AI agents in mobile scenarios by providing a comprehensive dataset that:

* **Provides a more instructive and detailed understanding of UI screens and elements:** The multi-level annotation scheme offers a more detailed understanding of the UI elements and their functionalities, enabling agents to learn more complex interactions.
* **Facilitates the development of generalist agents:**  AMEX's focus on general third-party applications and complex instructions promotes the development of agents capable of handling real-world tasks in diverse scenarios. 

**The authors also introduce a baseline model, SPHINX Agent, trained on both AMEX and AITW datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and showcasing its potential to drive further research in this field.**

**AMEX is open-source, providing a valuable resource for researchers working on developing more robust and capable mobile GUI-control agents.**
