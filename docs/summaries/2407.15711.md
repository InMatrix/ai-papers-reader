## Can Web Agents Solve Realistic and Time-Consuming Tasks? 

This blog post summarizes the research paper "ASSISTANTBENCH: Can Web Agents Solve Realistic and Time-Consuming Tasks?" by Ori Yoran et al. The paper tackles the challenge of evaluating the abilities of web agents, systems that can interact with the open web, to solve real-world, time-consuming tasks. 

The authors introduce **ASSISTANTBENCH**, a benchmark consisting of 214 diverse, realistic tasks, each requiring web browsing and information aggregation. These tasks, created by a diverse group of participants including domain experts, mirror the types of information-seeking tasks that humans frequently encounter. 

The authors analyze the performance of various systems on ASSISTANTBENCH, including language models (LMs), retrieval-augmented LMs, and state-of-the-art web agents. Their findings reveal that current systems struggle to achieve high accuracy, with no model surpassing a score of 25%. They highlight several key challenges:

* **Web Navigation:** Current web agents frequently make navigation errors, leading to incorrect trajectories or getting stuck in loops. This suggests that robust web navigation remains a significant hurdle for these systems.
* **Hallucinations:** Closed-book LMs perform relatively well in terms of answering rate, but they often hallucinate facts, leading to poor precision.
* **Retrieval Failure:** Retrieval-augmented models often fail to retrieve relevant information, or they retrieve irrelevant information that hinders their performance. 

To address these challenges, the authors introduce **SEEPLANACT (SPA)**, a new web agent that incorporates planning and memory components. SPA significantly outperforms existing web agents and achieves the best overall performance when combined with a closed-book model. However, even with SPA, ASSISTANTBENCH remains a challenging benchmark for web agents.

The paper concludes by discussing limitations and future directions.  The authors acknowledge that their benchmark is still relatively small and lacks time-dependent tasks, which will be crucial for further research. They highlight the importance of developing open-source web agents to enable wider accessibility and reproducibility. 

Overall, this paper sheds light on the limitations of current web agents and provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating future research in this field. The work underscores the importance of robust web navigation,  fact-checking, and retrieval capabilities for building more effective and trustworthy web agents.
