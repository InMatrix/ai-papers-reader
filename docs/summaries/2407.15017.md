## Unveiling the Secrets of Knowledge in Large Language Models: A Survey and Perspective

Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing artificial intelligence. Their ability to process and generate human-like text has unlocked unprecedented potential in various domains, from writing creative stories to translating languages. However, understanding the mechanisms by which LLMs learn, store, and utilize knowledge is crucial for building trustworthy and reliable AI systems. 

This paper offers a comprehensive survey and perspective on knowledge mechanisms in LLMs, proposing a novel taxonomy that encompasses both **knowledge utilization** and **knowledge evolution**. 

**Knowledge Utilization** delves into how LLMs employ their knowledge in three levels:

1. **Memorization:** This refers to the basic capacity of LLMs to store information, such as specific terms, facts, and grammatical rules. This is often attributed to specific modular regions within the LLM architecture, such as MLPs or attention heads. 
2. **Comprehension and Application:** Here, the focus shifts to how LLMs apply their memorized knowledge to solve problems and reason in new situations. This involves reusing specific components, such as neurons or knowledge circuits, and integrating knowledge from different regions. 
3. **Creation:** This level examines how LLMs generate novel and valuable content, going beyond mere repetition of existing knowledge. It's suggested that this ability relies on extrapolating existing knowledge and applying it to new contexts, potentially through a process akin to "random walks" within the model.

**Knowledge Evolution** explores how LLMs develop their knowledge over time, focusing on:

1. **Individual Evolution:** This refers to the dynamic learning process of individual LLMs, encompassing pre-training, fine-tuning, and post-training stages.  LLMs accumulate vast amounts of knowledge during pre-training but also face challenges with conflicting information and forgetting.  Fine-tuning and post-training help refine and integrate new knowledge, while editing techniques allow for targeted modifications. 
2. **Group Evolution:** This explores the collaborative learning process within groups of LLMs. Groups can leverage diverse knowledge and overcome individual limitations, but also face challenges with conflicting goals and ensuring the efficient sharing of information. 

The paper also discusses the potential for **dark knowledge**, which refers to knowledge that is unknown to both humans and machines. This includes aspects like human emotions, consciousness, and complex concepts that are not easily represented with existing data and models. 

Finally, the paper highlights the importance of interdisciplinarity in unraveling the mysteries of knowledge in LLMs. Insights from fields like neuroscience, psychology, education, and philosophy can provide valuable perspectives on how LLMs learn and evolve.  

The paper concludes with a discussion of critical challenges facing LLMs, including knowledge fragility, limitations in reasoning and planning, and the potential for biases and hallucinations. The paper argues that addressing these issues requires further research into the mechanisms of knowledge in LLMs, focusing on both parametric and non-parametric approaches to knowledge representation. 

The survey and perspective presented in this paper are essential reading for anyone interested in the future of AI. It lays out a roadmap for understanding the intricate workings of LLMs and provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
