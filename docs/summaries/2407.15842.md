## Artist:  Aesthetically Controllable Text-Driven Stylization without Training

**Introduction:**
This blog post summarizes a research paper titled "Artist: Aesthetically Controllable Text-Driven Stylization without Training" which presents a novel method for controlling the content and style generation of a pretrained diffusion model for text-driven stylization.  Existing methods struggle to effectively control the diffusion model, leading to undesired content modification and aesthetic issues. 

**The Problem:**
Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation but struggle with stylization tasks.  They entangle content and style generation during the denoising process, meaning that controlling style often leads to unwanted changes in the content. Existing methods like ControlNet, while successful for image translation, lack the flexibility and semantic-level control needed for stylization, resulting in discordant interpolation between different levels of content abstraction. 

**Artist: A Solution for Aesthetic Control:**
Artist, the proposed method, introduces a training-free approach that disentangles content and style generation into separate diffusion processes, enabling more fine-grained control. It achieves this by:

1. **Disentangling Content and Style:** Artist uses auxiliary diffusion branches, one for content and one for style, to separate the generation process. 
2. **Introducing Feature-Level Soft Constraints:** It applies feature-level soft constraints to control these auxiliary branches, allowing for greater control over content and style generation. 
3. **Introducing Content-Aware Style Generation:**  Content-aware style generation is achieved by injecting a query from the content branch to the style branch, ensuring that the style prompt aligns with the content. 

**Evaluation and Results:**
The paper thoroughly evaluates Artist using several metrics, including LPIPS, CLIP Alignment, and CLIP Style Score.  It also introduces novel VLM-based metrics for aesthetic evaluation, considering human preferences.  Results demonstrate that Artist achieves superior aesthetic-level control, preserving intricate details, aligning well with the style prompt, and showcasing high controllability of the stylization strength.  

**Key Contributions:**
* A thorough analysis of content and style entanglement in diffusion models.
* The introduction of auxiliary diffusion branches for disentangled content and style generation.
* The development of novel content and style factorization methods for fine-grained control.
* The introduction of VLMs for evaluating aesthetic-level stylization results.

**Conclusion:**
Artist presents a significant advancement in text-driven stylization. Its training-free approach and disentangled content and style control offer a robust solution for generating visually appealing and aesthetically controlled stylization results, highlighting the potential of diffusion models in artistic image generation.
