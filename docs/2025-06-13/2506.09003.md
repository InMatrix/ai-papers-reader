title: SWE-Flow&#58; AI Learns to Code Incrementally with Test-Driven Data Synthesis
---



Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in code-related tasks, but often struggle with the complex, iterative nature of real-world software development. A new approach called **SWE-Flow** aims to bridge this gap by synthesizing software engineering data in a way that mirrors how developers actually work: through Test-Driven Development (TDD).

Unlike existing datasets that rely on human-submitted issues, SWE-Flow automatically infers incremental development steps directly from unit tests. These tests encapsulate high-level requirements, providing a structured and verifiable path for LLMs to learn from.

The core of SWE-Flow is the **Runtime Dependency Graph (RDG)**. Imagine you're debugging code and need to trace how functions call each other. The RDG does exactly that, capturing function interactions during unit test execution. This allows SWE-Flow to generate a step-by-step development schedule. At each step, the system produces:

1.  **A partial codebase:**  This simulates the state of an incomplete project, missing the functions currently being developed.  Think of it as having a car with a missing engine, and the AI needs to build it.
2.  **Corresponding unit tests:** These tests serve as a precise specification of the functionality to be implemented.  They're like instructions for the AI, telling it what the engine needs to do (start, accelerate, etc.).
3.  **Necessary code modifications:**  This "diff" shows the AI exactly what needs to be added or changed in the codebase. It's like a blueprint showing how to assemble the engine.

"The key insight is that each unit test inherently represents a high-level expression of requirements," the authors write. This TDD approach ensures that the generated code is always executable and verifiable.

To validate SWE-Flow, the researchers created **SWE-Flow-Bench**, a new benchmark consisting of 16,061 training instances and 2,020 test instances from real-world GitHub projects. They then fine-tuned the open-source Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct LLM on this dataset. The results showed significant performance improvements in TDD-based coding, demonstrating SWE-Flow's effectiveness.

For example, imagine SWE-Flow is training on a function that calculates the price of an item after applying a discount and tax. The unit tests might include:

*   Test case 1: calculate\_price(100, 0.2) == 80.0 (20% discount)
*   Test case 2: calculate\_price(100, 0.0) == 100.0 (no discount)
*   Test case 3: calculate\_price(100, 1.0) == 0.0 (100% discount)

SWE-Flow would then generate the partial codebase (missing the `calculate_price` function), the unit tests as a requirement document, and the "diff" showing how to implement the function to satisfy these tests.

The SWE-Flow approach offers several advantages:

*   **Verifiability:**  Code is centered on executable unit tests.
*   **Scalability:**  It can be applied to any codebase with unit tests.
*   **Configurability:**  Difficulty can be adjusted based on the complexity of function calls.

The researchers have released all code, datasets, and models to foster further research in this area. They also suggest future directions, such as scaling SWE-Flow data for pre-training and integrating it with reinforcement learning to further enhance LLMs' software engineering capabilities.
