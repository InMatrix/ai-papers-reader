## Generative AI for Assisting Software Developers

### SWEET-RL: Training Multi-Turn LLM Agents on Collaborative Reasoning Tasks

**Relevance:** This paper introduces ColBench, a benchmark where an LLM agent collaborates with a human over multiple turns to solve realistic backend programming and frontend design tasks. It directly addresses using generative AI (specifically LLMs) to assist in software development by creating a benchmark and algorithm (SWEET-RL) to optimize these collaborative coding scenarios. The paper shows an LLM agent's ability to assist in the process of content creation and problem solving, which are common tasks for software developers. The performance improvements indicate its potential to automate or augment collaborative coding processes.

### STEVE: AStep Verification Pipeline for Computer-use Agent Training

**Relevance:** STEVE presents a method for training AI agents to interact with graphical user interfaces, effectively assisting in software development-related tasks.  The core idea of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to verify the correctness of steps taken by an agent in performing computer tasks, combined with Kahneman and Tversky Optimization, can be highly valuable for guiding an agent to perform software development tasks such as code refactoring, debugging, or documentation.  It offers a way to improve agent performance through feedback and optimization specifically for GUI-based workflows common in software development.

## AI Agents

### LLM-Mediated Guidance of MARL Systems

**Relevance:** This work explores using LLMs to guide Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems towards desirable behaviors in complex multi-agent environments. This aligns with the core focus of AI agent research, specifically in enabling agents to learn effective strategies through interaction and feedback. The paper uses LLMs as controllers to intervene and shape the learning trajectories of multiple agents, demonstrating a practical approach to guide agent behavior, which is a key objective in AI agent development.  The success of NL controllers (using LLMs to simulate human-like interventions) shows a pathway for creating more human-aligned AI agents.

### STEVE: AStep Verification Pipeline for Computer-use Agent Training

**Relevance:** STEVE focuses on training AI agents to autonomously manipulate graphical user interfaces. This is a central problem in AI agent research, as it enables agents to interact with a wide range of digital environments. The use of GPT-4o to verify the correctness of actions, followed by Kahneman and Tversky Optimization, exemplifies how to train agents to make better decisions and accomplish tasks within a computer environment. The WinAgentArena benchmark further contextualizes the agent's performance in a challenging, realistic setting.

### CoLMDriver: LLM-based Negotiation Benefits Cooperative Autonomous Driving

**Relevance:** CoLMDriver introduces an LLM-based cooperative driving system that enables language-based negotiation and real-time driving control between vehicles. This embodies the concept of AI agents that can reason, plan, and interact with each other in a complex environment. The LLM-based negotiation module, under an actor-critic paradigm, learns cooperation policies through feedback, mirroring how AI agents should adapt and improve their strategies. The InterDrive benchmark demonstrates the agent's capability to collaborate and solve interactive driving scenarios, showcasing practical AI agent behavior.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### MetaLadder: Ascending Mathematical Solution Quality via Analogical-Problem Reasoning Transfer

**Relevance:** This paper presents MetaLadder, a framework that explicitly prompts LLMs to recall and reflect on analogous problems and their solutions before addressing the target problem. This directly implements prompt engineering by guiding the LLM with meta-problems and a problem-restating mechanism. This simulates human-like learning from examples and improves reasoning accuracy. The prompts are carefully designed to influence the model's approach and improve its problem-solving abilities, showcasing how prompt engineering can boost performance significantly.

## Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning

### STEVE: AStep Verification Pipeline for Computer-use Agent Training

**Relevance:** STEVE uses GPT-4o to verify the correctness of the steps taken by an agent, providing feedback to the agent on each step. This verification process simulates human input and guides the agent's learning through positive and negative examples. The use of human or AI-verified labels is a direct application of human-in-the-loop techniques, where the AI's performance is improved through feedback and guidance.

### Optimizing Decomposition for Optimal Claim Verification

**Relevance:** This paper formulates the process of finding the optimal decomposition policy for fact verification as a bilevel optimization problem. It trains a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims. The verifier feedback acts as the 'human-in-the-loop' element, guiding the decomposition process to align with the verifier's needs and preferences, thereby improving verification accuracy and confidence.

## Techniques for Explaining AI Behavior

### VERIFY: A Benchmark of Visual Explanation and Reasoning for Investigating Multimodal Reasoning Fidelity

**Relevance:** VERIFY is a benchmark designed to evaluate the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, emphasizing the need to understand the model's decision-making processes. The benchmark includes human-annotated reasoning paths, which allows for in-depth evaluation beyond just accuracy. The new metrics focus on assessing visual reasoning fidelity, helping to identify imbalances in model reasoning patterns. This directly addresses the explainability of AI behavior by focusing on the reasoning steps taken by the models.

**Relevance:** LEGION introduces a multimodal large language model (MLLM)-based image forgery analysis framework that integrates artifact detection, segmentation, and explanation. This relates to XAI because it explicitly aims to provide textual explanations for why an image is considered synthetic, which allows a user to understand how the AI is making its decision. This provides the rationale behind AI decision-making in a way that can be inspected and validated.

### EvalTree: Profiling Language Model Weaknesses via Hierarchical Capability Trees

**Relevance:** EvalTree introduces a weakness profiling method that generates a set of weaknesses expressed in natural language, given a language model's performance on a benchmark.  This involves constructing a capability tree where each node represents a capability and is linked to benchmark instances that evaluate it. This directly addresses the explainability of AI by generating natural language descriptions of its weaknesses based on its performance on specific tasks. By identifying where the model fails and providing actionable guidance, EvalTree aids in understanding and improving AI behavior.
