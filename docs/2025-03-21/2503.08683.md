title: LLM-Powered Autonomous Driving&#58; Negotiating Safety on the Road
---


A team of researchers has unveiled "CoLMDriver," a novel autonomous driving system that uses large language models (LLMs) to improve safety and efficiency through language-based negotiation between vehicles. This research addresses the limitations of traditional cooperative driving methods, which often struggle with unseen interactive scenarios.

Existing methods usually rely on rigid protocols or complex optimization algorithms that may not generalize well. LLMs offer a more flexible approach due to their reasoning capabilities and vast knowledge. However, direct integration of LLMs poses challenges such as spatial planning and unstable inference latency.

CoLMDriver tackles these issues with a parallel driving pipeline:
1.  **LLM-Based Negotiation Module**: This module employs an "actor-critic" paradigm, where LLMs continuously refine cooperation policies based on feedback from previous decisions. Imagine two cars approaching an intersection. One car might say, "I will proceed straight; please yield." The other replies, "Sure, I am making a slow right turn." A "critic" evaluates this exchange, identifying potential collisions. The LLMs then negotiate further, perhaps with one car agreeing to brake and wait.
2.  **Intention-Guided Waypoint Generator**: This component translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints, essentially converting high-level agreements into precise driving instructions.

The researchers introduce "InterDrive," a new simulation benchmark in CARLA, comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios. Experimental results show that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving an 11% higher success rate.
The LLM in CoLMDriver guides waypoint generation, and the waypoints provide feedback to refine cooperation strategies, forming an online optimization loop. 
By focusing on relevant collaborators and incorporating an auxiliary VLM-based intention planner, the system handles non-cooperation periods effectively. This design enables the system to operate in real-time with efficient planning negotiation.

Imagine a complex merging scenario on a highway. With CoLMDriver, vehicles communicate their intentions and adjust their trajectories accordingly, resulting in smoother and safer merges compared to systems that rely on pre-defined rules or solely on sensor data.
The code will be released on GitHub.
