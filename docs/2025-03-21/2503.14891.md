title: MetaLadder Aims to Improve Math Reasoning in Large Language Models through
  Analogical Problem Solving
---



Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in tackling mathematical reasoning tasks. However, a new paper proposes a method called "MetaLadder" to improve their accuracy by mimicking how humans approach problem-solving. The idea is to encourage LLMs to recall and learn from structurally or semantically similar problems (analogous problems) before attempting to solve the target problem. This approach aims to bridge the gap between current LLM training and nuanced human cognitive processes.

In the traditional approach to solving math problems, LLMs are trained using "Chain-of-Thought" (CoT) data, which guides the model to break down a problem into smaller steps.  While effective, this "Problem -> CoT -> Answer" framework differs from how humans solve complex problems.  For example, if a student encounters a challenging combinatorics question, they will likely remember similar permutation problems they have previously solved to aid in guiding them to a solution.

MetaLadder addresses this deficiency by explicitly prompting LLMs to recall meta-problems and reflect on their solutions before answering the target problem. The researchers also implemented a "problem-restating" mechanism, where the model regenerates the original question to solidify its comprehension of the problem's core components and constraints. This analogical recall with active restatement allows the model to effectively mimic the human ability to "learn from examples" and generalize solutions across analogous contexts.

The researchers conducted extensive experiments using popular math benchmarks like GSM8K and MATH. Models trained with MetaLadder showed significant improvements over standard CoT fine-tuning methods, demonstrating accuracy gains of 12.4% and 11.3% on GSM8K and MATH respectively. Moreover, MetaLadder-trained models exhibited stronger generalization to structurally novel problems, solving 9.3% more "out-of-distribution" test cases than regular CoT models.

To better understand the impact of each component of MetaLadder, the researchers performed an ablation study, systematically removing elements of the framework. The absence of either the problem type and solution method, analogy meta-problem, or problem restating mechanism each resulted in significant performance drops. This validates the crucial role of each component in enhancing the model's reasoning ability.

Overall, the findings highlight the importance of emulating human-like analogical reasoning and active comprehension for advancing LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities. Future research may build on this approach to improve the quality of generated analogy problems to further extend and improve the problem-solving capacities of LLMs.
