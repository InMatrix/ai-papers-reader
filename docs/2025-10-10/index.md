## LLM Evaluation Methods

### A Single Character can Make or Break Your LLM Evals

**Relevance:** This paper unveils a significant vulnerability in LLM evaluation: the dramatic impact of minor formatting choices, like delimiters, on model performance. It demonstrates how such subtle changes can 'dramatically alter model response quality' and even 'manipulate model rankings'. From an HCI perspective, this highlights fundamental issues with the robustness and reliability of current LLM evaluation methods, which can misrepresent model capabilities and hinder fair comparisons. It underscores the need for more robust evaluation protocols that consider the sensitivity of LLMs to input presentation, ensuring trust and confidence in reported performance.

### When Benchmarks Age: Temporal Misalignment through Large Language Model Factuality Evaluation

**Relevance:** This paper critically examines the issue of 'benchmark aging' and its impact on LLM factuality evaluation. It shows that widely used benchmarks become outdated due to the rapid evolution of LLMs and the real world, leading to unreliable assessments. For HCI, this is vital because user trust in LLMs heavily relies on their factual accuracy and reliability. If evaluation methods are temporally misaligned, developers and users might make decisions based on flawed understanding of model capabilities. This work emphasizes the need for dynamic, up-to-date evaluation strategies to ensure LLMs remain aligned with user expectations for factual correctness.

### Vibe Checker: Aligning Code Evaluation with Human Preference

**Relevance:** This paper addresses a crucial gap in LLM evaluation for software development by proposing 'Vibe Checker', a testbed that assesses not only functional correctness but also 'code instruction following' and 'human preference'. It introduces 'VeriCode' to quantify these non-functional aspects. From an HCI standpoint, this work directly bridges the gap between technical LLM performance metrics and real-world user satisfaction. By evaluating models based on how well they align with human 'vibe checks' in coding, it provides a concrete path for benchmarking and developing AI tools that better meet user needs and expectations, enhancing developer experience and trust.

## Reinforcement Learning

### The Markovian Thinker

**Relevance:** This paper proposes 'Markovian Thinking', a novel reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm for training reasoning LLMs that generate long chains of thought. It tackles the quadratic compute overhead of traditional attention-based policies by decoupling thinking length from context size, enabling linear compute. From an HCI perspective, efficient long-context reasoning is crucial for agents that need to understand complex user queries or maintain state over extended interactions. By making long reasoning more scalable and efficient, this RL advancement enables the development of more capable and responsive AI systems for human users, reducing latency and improving overall performance.

## Explainable AI

### Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning Traces

**Relevance:** This paper proposes an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and uniformity scores to analyze LLM reasoning traces, finding that step-level uniformity correlates with reasoning quality. From an XAI perspective, this provides a novel 'theoretical lens' and 'robust diagnostic and selection criterion' for understanding *how* LLMs reason. By revealing that correct traces avoid sharp information spikes, it offers insights into the internal decision-making process, contributing to model transparency and interpretability. This method helps users and developers gain a deeper understanding of LLM reliability and improve reasoning systems, which is central to building trustworthy AI.

### Revisiting Long-context Modeling from Context Denoising Perspective

**Relevance:** This paper analyzes how long-context models (LCMs) are susceptible to contextual noise and introduces the Integrated Gradient (IG) score to detect and quantify this noise. From an XAI perspective, the IG score offers a valuable diagnostic tool for transparency by explaining *why* an LCM might be misled or make a particular decision due to irrelevant information. By identifying influential (or misleading) features in the input, it helps users understand the decision boundaries and potential failure modes of complex models. This contributes to building more reliable and interpretable long-context models.
