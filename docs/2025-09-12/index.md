### SimpleQA Verified: A Reliable Factuality Benchmark to Measure Parametric Knowledge

**Relevance:** This paper introduces SimpleQA Verified, a rigorous 1,000-prompt benchmark for evaluating LLM short-form factuality. It addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by employing a multi-stage filtering process (de-duplication, topic balancing, source reconciliation) to produce a more reliable and challenging evaluation set, alongside improvements in the autorater prompt. This directly contributes to LLM evaluation by providing a higher-fidelity tool to track progress in parametric model factuality, measure hallucination rates, and enhance user trust in information retrieved from LLMs.

### Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Yet

**Relevance:** This work evaluates the effectiveness of increasing test-time computation in reasoning models for knowledge-intensive tasks, focusing on factual accuracy and hallucination rates. It highlights that extended reasoning does not consistently improve accuracy and can even increase hallucinations, suggesting that current methods may induce confirmation bias. From an HCI perspective, this research is crucial for understanding LLM robustness, reliability, and the potential for cognitive load or misinformation when users interact with 'thinking' models, informing safer deployment and interaction design for complex information retrieval.
