title: Large Language Models Develop Human-Like Reasoning Hierarchy Through Reinforcement
  Learning
---



**New research suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) develop reasoning abilities through a two-phase process, mirroring human cognitive hierarchies.**

In a significant advancement for artificial intelligence, researchers have uncovered a fundamental mechanism behind how Large Language Models (LLMs) learn to reason. Published in a recent preprint, the study reveals that LLMs, when trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL), develop a sophisticated reasoning hierarchy that closely resembles human cognition. This hierarchy separates high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution, a process that explains previously observed "aha moments" and "length-scaling" phenomena in LLMs.

The research highlights a two-phase learning dynamic. Initially, LLMs focus on mastering procedural correctness, ensuring that individual steps in a reasoning process are accurate. This is akin to a student learning basic arithmetic before tackling complex algebra. For instance, a model might first learn to accurately perform calculations or correctly substitute variables in an equation.

Once these foundational "low-level execution tokens" are reliably mastered, the learning bottleneck shifts to "high-level planning tokens." This phase involves the model learning to strategize, deduce, branch, and backtrack â€“ essentially, orchestrating the reasoning process. Think of this as a chess player not only knowing how each piece moves but also developing overarching strategies to win the game. The study uses "Strategic Grams," specific n-grams that signify strategic maneuvers like "let's try a different approach" or "we can use the fact that," to identify these planning tokens.

This emergent hierarchy explains why LLMs sometimes exhibit "aha moments," where they suddenly grasp a complex problem. These moments, the researchers argue, represent the model's discovery and internalization of new, powerful high-level strategies. Similarly, "length-scaling," where LLMs produce longer and more detailed outputs as they improve, is attributed to the increased complexity of these sophisticated planning strategies.

The paper criticizes current RL algorithms like GRPO for applying optimization pressure uniformly across all tokens. This "agnostic" approach, the researchers argue, dilutes the learning signal and is inefficient. To address this, they introduce **Hierarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA)**, a novel algorithm that specifically targets and amplifies the learning signal for high-impact planning tokens. By concentrating on the strategic bottleneck, HICRA significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating advanced reasoning capabilities.

Furthermore, the study introduces **semantic entropy** as a more reliable metric for measuring strategic exploration compared to traditional token-level entropy. While token-level entropy can be misleading, suggesting a decrease in exploration when LLMs become confident in low-level tasks, semantic entropy accurately captures the diversity of high-level strategies being developed.

In essence, this research provides a unified framework for understanding how LLMs achieve complex reasoning, offering a blueprint for developing more efficient and effective AI systems by mimicking the hierarchical nature of human thought.
