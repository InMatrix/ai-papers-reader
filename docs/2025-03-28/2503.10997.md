title: RONA&#58; A New AI Tool Generates More Diverse and Relevant Image Captions
---



Writing Assistants, powered by AI, are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives. While these tools have become adept at generating text for various tasks, including image captioning, the diversity and relevance of these captions often leave something to be desired.  Existing AI-powered captioning systems tend to focus on syntactic or semantic variations, often missing the pragmatic nuances that make human-written captions engaging and relatable.

Now, a new research paper introduces RONA (Relation-based coherence-aware cAptioning), a novel prompting strategy for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). RONA leverages Coherence Relations (CRs) to guide the generation of captions, resulting in more diverse and contextually relevant descriptions.

**What are Coherence Relations?**

Coherence Relations, based on the principles of Discourse Theory, provide a structured overview of image-text relationships. They define how different parts of a text relate to each other and to the image they describe. The researchers behind RONA identified five key types of relations that can be used to guide caption generation:

*   **Insertion:**  The caption mentions a general theme or feeling related to the image, without explicitly stating the obvious visual elements.  For example, for an image of a fox sleeping on white sheets, an insertion-based caption might be: "Sweet dreams are made of soft white sheets and peaceful afternoon naps."

*   **Concretization:**  The caption provides specific details about an object that's already mentioned. In the burger example from the included figure, this could mean specifying that "Vanilla ice cream is garnished with crispy honeycomb pieces in a blue ceramic bowl" (image of ice cream).

*   **Projection:** The caption describes a topic or idea that isn't directly depicted in the image, but is associated with it.  For instance, for an image of a sleeping fox: "Finding complete comfort and trust in one's surroundings is a rare and precious thing."

*   **Restatement:** This type of caption offers a more detailed description of the visual scene.

*   **Extension:**  The caption elaborates further on the visual scene, introducing new ideas or stories.

**How Does RONA Work?**

RONA uses these CRs as guidelines for prompting MLLMs. The system prompts include definitions of each CR, guiding the model to generate captions that fulfill specific communicative functions while remaining semantically coherent.  By forcing the model to consider different types of relationships between the image and text, RONA encourages the generation of a broader range of captions.

**The Results**

The researchers evaluated RONA using two popular MLLMs, Claude-3.5 Sonnet V2 and GPT-40, on two datasets: news captions (ANNA) and social media captions (Tweet Subtitles).  The results demonstrate that RONA consistently outperformed existing MLLM baselines in terms of both diversity and ground-truth alignment. RONA enabled the models to generate a greater variety of captions, while also maintaining semantic and contextual relevance.

**Why is this important?**

This work suggests a promising direction for improving the quality and usefulness of AI-powered writing assistants. By leveraging Coherence Relations, RONA demonstrates that it's possible to generate more diverse, engaging, and contextually relevant image captions. This research could have significant implications for various applications, from social media management to content creation and accessibility. RONA offers a framework for improving the way AI interacts with and understands multimodal content, bridging the gap between simple visual descriptions and richer, more meaningful communication.
