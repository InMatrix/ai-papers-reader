## Human-in-the-loop machine learning for improved training or evaluation
### ViPer: Visual Personalization of Generative Models via Individual Preference Learning
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents a method for personalizing image generation based on user preferences. This approach involves capturing a user's visual preferences through a one-time process where the user provides feedback on a small selection of images. The inferred preferences are then used to guide a text-to-image model to produce images aligned with the user's individual taste. This is relevant to human-in-the-loop machine learning as it explores how to incorporate human feedback into the training process for improved model performance and personalization.

### BOND: Aligning LLMs with Best-of-N Distillation
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes Best-of-N Distillation (BOND), an RLHF algorithm that aims to emulate the benefits of Best-of-N sampling, which involves selecting the best generation from multiple candidates, without the associated computational overhead. BOND achieves this by using a distribution matching technique that forces the distribution of generations from the policy to align with the Best-of-N distribution. This method directly addresses the integration of human feedback into the training of LLMs, aligning with the human-in-the-loop paradigm.
