title: AI Models Learn to "Think" in Concepts, Not Just Tokens
---



A team of researchers at Meta’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) has unveiled a novel pretraining framework for large language models (LLMs) called Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix). This approach augments the traditional method of predicting the next token with an explicit mechanism for integrating continuous, high-level semantic concepts directly into the model's internal reasoning process.

The breakthrough promises to make future LLMs significantly more sample efficient, requiring less massive datasets to achieve high performance, while also offering unprecedented control and interpretability.

For decades, LLMs have relied on next-token prediction (NTP), optimizing for token-level accuracy (like predicting "cat" after "the big"). While effective, this process forces the model to laboriously infer complex reasoning and abstract concepts from superficial word patterns. CoCoMix addresses this by making concept learning a parallel training objective.

### Extracting and Interleaving Concepts

CoCoMix operates in three steps. First, it extracts core semantic concepts by leveraging a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). SAEs decompose the dense internal states of an LLM into thousands of distinct, sparse features—for instance, identifying concepts related to "website address" or "monthly expense."

Second, the system uses an attribution score—a measure of causal influence—to select only the most critical concepts needed for the next prediction.

Finally, the main LLM is trained not only to predict the next language token but also to predict this specific set of relevant concepts. These predicted concepts are compressed into a compact, continuous vector and "mixed" into the hidden state, interleaving with the standard token representations. This forces the model to explicitly incorporate high-level abstract thought alongside its token prediction.

### Higher Performance on Less Data

Experiments demonstrated that CoCoMix consistently outperforms standard NTP, particularly in demanding scenarios. When applied to a 1.38-billion-parameter model, CoCoMix matched the performance of a standard NTP model while using 21.5% fewer training tokens, highlighting its high sample efficiency.

Crucially, CoCoMix excelled in "weak-to-strong supervision" setups, where concepts extracted from a smaller, weaker teacher model (124M parameters) were successfully used to guide the training of a much larger, 386M-parameter student model. This capability significantly surpassed traditional Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, which often struggle when the student surpasses the teacher's knowledge.

### Steering the Model's Reasoning

Perhaps the most compelling outcome is the enhanced interpretability and steerability. Because concepts are represented by a distinct, manipulable vector, researchers can directly probe or modify the model's internal predictions to influence its output.

For example, when asked to complete the prompt, "The best platform for buying tickets is the...," a non-steered model might default to a generic answer. However, if the researcher amplifies the predicted vector component corresponding to "website address related," the model immediately generates specific URLs like “Ticketmaster.com.” Similarly, amplifying a "month/year related" concept causes the model to generate completions referencing "by the end of the year" or "two-year-old."

CoCoMix offers a transparent window into an LLM's internal reasoning, connecting fine-grained token generation with high-level conceptual understanding. The authors conclude that this integration of continuous concepts is key to bridging semantic abstraction and efficient, guided language modeling.
