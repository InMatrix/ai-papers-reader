## Generative AI for Assisting Software Developers

### CRUST-Bench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for C-to-safe-Rust Transpilation

**Relevance:** This paper directly addresses code generation, specifically the challenging task of transpiling C code to safe Rust.  It introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on this task, which involves understanding code, generating equivalent code in another language, and ensuring memory safety.  The results highlight the current limitations of LLMs in producing safe and idiomatic Rust, indicating a need for further research and potentially HCI-driven approaches to guide the code generation process and improve usability for developers.

### Rethinking the Generation of High-Quality CoT Data from the Perspective of LLM-Adaptive Question Difficulty Grading

**Relevance:** This paper explores how to generate better chain-of-thought (CoT) data for code generation tasks and improve reasoning. This is relevant because automatically generating high-quality training data for code generation can reduce the need for human intervention and improve the performance of AI-assisted coding tools. It can also reduce the cost for data generation and enhance the efficiency of model supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leading to better usability for developers.

## AI Agents

### Causal-Copilot: An Autonomous Causal Analysis Agent

**Relevance:** This paper presents an autonomous agent that automates causal analysis.  Its relevance to AI Agents lies in its ability to independently perform a complex task (causal analysis) and interact with users through natural language, a key aspect of AI agent research.  The paper emphasizes the agent's ability to automate the full pipeline of causal analysis including discovery, inference, algorithm selection, result interpretation, and action generation.

### WALL-E 2.0: World Alignment by NeuroSymbolic Learning improves World Model-based LLM Agents

**Relevance:** WALL-E 2.0 is directly relevant as it presents a model-based agent that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge (action rules, knowledge graphs) to improve performance. The agent uses an LLM for planning and integrates symbolic knowledge to regulate its policies. This integration of neurosymbolic learning aligns with the goals of creating more robust and efficient AI agents capable of interacting with complex environments, such as game environments or embodied indoor environments.

### Progent: Programmable Privilege Control for LLM Agents

**Relevance:** Progent is directly relevant to AI Agents because it focuses on security risks posed by them. The work proposes a privilege control mechanism to limit the actions LLM agents can perform, preventing malicious commands from causing harm. By enabling developers to create policies that restrict tool usage based on user queries, Progent enhances the safety and usability of LLM agents in real-world scenarios, which is a crucial aspect of responsible AI agent design.

## Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning

### Pre-DPO: Improving Data Utilization in Direct Preference Optimization Using a Guiding Reference Model

**Relevance:** This paper explores Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) which simplifies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs) by directly optimizing human preferences without an explicit reward model. Improving data utilization is important in scenarios where human feedback is limited or expensive, such as active learning or reinforcement learning from human feedback.
