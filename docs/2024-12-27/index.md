## Generative AI for Assisting Software Developers

### Outcome-Refining Process Supervision for Code Generation

**Relevance:** This paper directly addresses the challenge of improving code generation in LLMs by focusing on complex programming tasks requiring algorithmic reasoning.  The proposed Outcome-Refining Process Supervision framework uses execution signals to supervise reasoning steps, leading to higher success accuracy and efficiency. This is directly applicable to assisting software developers by generating more accurate and efficient code, and improving the reliability of code verification, thus enhancing productivity and reducing errors.

### Agent-SafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of LLM Agents

**Relevance:** This paper introduces Agent-SafetyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the safety of LLM agents interacting with tools and environments.  The benchmark's focus on various safety risks and failure modes directly addresses critical issues in the development and deployment of AI agents.  The identification of critical failure modes (lack of robustness and risk awareness) and the release of the benchmark itself are highly significant contributions to the field of AI agent safety.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Token-Budget-Aware LLM Reasoning

**Relevance:** This paper addresses the high token usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a key technique in prompt engineering.  It proposes a framework that dynamically estimates token budgets based on reasoning complexity, aiming to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. This directly addresses a practical limitation of CoT prompting, making it more resource-efficient and potentially more accessible for wider adoption in various applications.

### Ensembling Large Language Models with Process Reward-Guided Tree Search for Better Complex Reasoning

**Relevance:** This paper introduces LE-MCTS, a framework for ensembling LLMs using Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by process-based reward models. This method facilitates more effective reasoning processes, a key aspect of advanced prompt engineering techniques. By strategically combining the strengths of multiple LLMs and using a tree search to find optimal reasoning paths, this approach improves the overall quality and robustness of responses elicited through prompt engineering.

## Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning

### PC Agent: While You Sleep, AI Works -- A Cognitive Journey into Digital World

**Relevance:** This paper is relevant because it emphasizes collecting high-quality human-computer interaction data to train more capable AI agents. The PC Tracker infrastructure is explicitly designed for this purpose, making it a prime example of human-in-the-loop learning where human interaction data directly informs the AI model training.  This iterative refinement, incorporating human feedback, is core to human-in-the-loop machine learning.
