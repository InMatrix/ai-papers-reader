- *Relevant Paper*: Arena-Hard and BenchBuilder Pipeline
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents a method for creating high-quality benchmarks that are aligned with human preferences. The BenchBuilder pipeline extracts high-quality prompts from live crowd-sourced platforms like the Chatbot Arena, which collect a wide range of natural prompts and user feedback. The authors argue that using real-world user data to create benchmarks is crucial for ensuring that the benchmarks are relevant to the needs of users.

**What are the novel prompt engineering techniques that improve the performance of AI systems?**

- *Relevant Paper*: Whiteboard-of-Thought: Thinking Step-by-Step Across Modalities
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces a new prompting technique called whiteboard-of-thought prompting, which enables multimodal large language models to solve visual reasoning tasks by drawing out reasoning steps as images. The authors demonstrate that this technique can be used to significantly improve the performance of large language models on tasks that require visual reasoning.

- *Relevant Paper*: Not All Prompts Are Made Equal: Prompt-based Pruning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes a novel prompt-based pruning method for text-to-image diffusion models. The method uses a prompt router model to determine the required capacity for an input text prompt and routes it to an architecture code, given a total desired compute budget for prompts. This approach allows for the efficient pruning of text-to-image diffusion models while maintaining high performance.

- *Relevant Paper*: Learn Beyond The Answer: Training Language Models with Reflection for Mathematical Reasoning
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes a novel technique called reflective augmentation for training language models on mathematical reasoning tasks. The technique embeds problem reflection into each training instance, encouraging the model to consider alternative perspectives and engage with abstractions and analogies. This approach leads to improved performance on complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

**How can the human-in-the-loop approach improve the model training process?**

- *Relevant Paper*: Bootstrapping Language Models with DPO Implicit Rewards
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces a new approach called DICE, which leverages the implicit reward model from direct preference optimization (DPO) to further align large language models with human preferences. DICE uses the rewards from a current LLM model to construct a preference dataset, which is then used in subsequent DPO rounds. The authors demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the alignment of large language models with human preferences.

- *Relevant Paper*: BPO: Supercharging Online Preference Learning by Adhering to the Proximity of Behavior LLM
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces an online preference optimization method called BPO, which emphasizes the importance of constructing a proper trust region for LLM alignment. BPO aims to ensure that the learned LLM adheres to the proximity of the behavior LLM, which collects the training samples. The authors demonstrate that this approach leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range of tasks.

    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces a novel autonomous reinforcement learning approach called DigiRL for training in-the-wild device control agents. DigiRL fine-tunes a pre-trained VLM in two stages: offline RL to initialize the model, followed by offline-to-online RL. The authors demonstrate that DigiRL can be used to train agents that can effectively control real GUIs in real-world scenarios.
