### Improve Vision Language Model Chain-of-thought Reasoning

**Relevance:** This paper investigates how to improve the chain-of-thought reasoning capabilities of vision language models (VLMs) through prompt engineering techniques. It highlights the limitations of traditional training methods and proposes a two-fold approach: enriching training data with distilled rationales and applying reinforcement learning to refine reasoning quality. This directly addresses the topic of prompt engineering by exploring how carefully designed prompts can enhance VLM's ability to break down complex problems and generate step-by-step reasoning processes.

## Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning

### Aligning Large Language Models via Self-Steering Optimization

**Relevance:** This paper introduces Self-Steering Optimization (SSO), a human-in-the-loop technique for aligning large language models. SSO autonomously generates preference signals based on predefined principles, eliminating the need for manual annotation. This approach allows for efficient and effective alignment by incorporating human-defined preferences into the training process without requiring direct human intervention. This directly aligns with the concept of Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning by proposing a method for incorporating human feedback into the optimization process.

## Generative AI for UI Design and Engineering

### Lightweight Neural App Control

**Relevance:** This paper focuses on using AI to control mobile applications through natural language instructions. It proposes LiMAC, a lightweight multi-modal app control system that generates precise actions based on textual goals and visual observations of the app's user interface. This system demonstrates the potential of generative AI in automating UI interactions and enhancing user experiences. While not directly about UI design, LiMAC's approach of using AI to control and understand UI elements has implications for future generative UI design tools.

## Techniques for Explaining AI behavior

### Mitigating Object Hallucination via Concentric Causal Attention

**Relevance:** This paper explores the issue of object hallucination in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and proposes a solution to improve their transparency and explainability. It analyzes the root cause of hallucination, identifies the role of positional encoding, and introduces Concentric Causal Attention (CCA) to mitigate its impact. CCA enhances the model's ability to align visual cues with instructions, leading to more accurate and interpretable outputs. This directly addresses the topic of Explainable AI by improving the model's transparency and providing insights into its decision-making process.
