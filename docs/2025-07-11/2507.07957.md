title: MIRIX System Promises "True Memory" for AI Agents, Excelling in Real-World
  Scenarios
---



**San Francisco, CA** - Artificial intelligence agents are rapidly becoming more sophisticated, but a fundamental limitation has hindered their ability to truly learn and personalize user experiences: memory. Until now, most AI agents operated with a form of "forgetfulness," requiring users to re-explain context or provide information repeatedly. A new system called MIRIX, developed by researchers at MIRIX AI, aims to revolutionize this by providing AI agents with robust, long-term memory capabilities.

MIRIX is a modular memory system designed to address the critical challenge of enabling language models to genuinely remember and utilize past information. Unlike previous approaches that often rely on a single, flat memory structure, MIRIX employs a sophisticated architecture with six distinct memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource, and Knowledge Vault. Each of these components is specialized for storing different kinds of information, from user preferences and past events to step-by-step guides and sensitive personal data.

**How MIRIX Works: A Multi-Agent Approach**

The system's innovation lies not only in its diverse memory types but also in its multi-agent framework. This architecture utilizes specialized "Memory Managers" for each memory component, all coordinated by a central "Meta Memory Manager." This allows for dynamic control and efficient retrieval of information. For example, when a user interacts with an AI assistant, MIRIX can store a significant event, like attending a conference, in its Episodic Memory. If the user later asks about their experiences at that conference, MIRIX can quickly access and recall the detailed information.

To make its capabilities tangible, the MIRIX team demonstrated the system's effectiveness in two challenging benchmarks. The first, a novel multimodal benchmark called ScreenshotVQA, required the AI to process nearly 20,000 high-resolution computer screenshots capturing a user's activity over a month. In this demanding setting, MIRIX achieved a 35% higher accuracy than existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) baselines, while drastically reducing storage requirements by an impressive 99.9%. This highlights MIRIX's ability to handle rich visual data and store it efficiently.

The second benchmark, LOCOMO, focused on long-form conversations. Here, MIRIX demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 85.4% accuracy. Crucially, the system was able to answer questions based solely on its retrieved memories, without access to the original conversation transcripts, showcasing its capacity for independent knowledge recall.

**Beyond Benchmarks: A Personal Assistant Experience**

To allow users to experience the benefits of advanced memory firsthand, MIRIX has also been integrated into a personal assistant application. This application monitors a user's screen in real-time, continuously building a personalized memory base. Users can then interact with the assistant, asking questions about their past activities, and receiving contextually relevant answers. This application also features intuitive memory visualization and secure local storage to ensure user privacy.

The development of MIRIX represents a significant step forward in creating AI agents that can truly learn, adapt, and provide personalized assistance over time, mimicking the way humans utilize their own memories. The researchers believe this technology will be particularly impactful for the growing market of wearable devices, enabling more intelligent and context-aware AI companions.
