## AI for Software Development

### Rethinking Verification for LLM Code Generation: From Generation to Testing

**Relevance:** This paper directly addresses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, a core AI for Software Development task. It highlights the limitations of current evaluation benchmarks, which often miss subtle faults, inflating performance. From an HCI perspective, this means developers might implicitly trust incomplete AI-generated code. The paper proposes methods for generating more thorough test cases and a human-LLM collaborative approach (SAGA) to enhance test quality and coverage, aiming for a more reliable foundation for LLM-based code generation and improving the trustworthiness and utility of AI tools for software developers.

### High-Resolution Visual Reasoning via Multi-Turn Grounding-Based Reinforcement Learning

**Relevance:** This paper introduces Multi-turn Grounding-based Policy Optimization (MGPO), an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework for Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) to perform high-resolution visual reasoning. It enables LMMs to iteratively focus on relevant visual regions through automatic cropping, based on model-predicted grounding coordinates. Crucially, this approach teaches LMMs robust grounding abilities during RL training without costly explicit grounding annotations. From an HCI perspective, MGPO enhances the interpretability and efficiency of multimodal AI by allowing models to 'focus' on specific visual details relevant to a query, making their reasoning more transparent and reliable for human users.

## Explainable AI

### Towards Solving More Challenging IMO Problems via Decoupled Reasoning and Proving

**Relevance:** This paper proposes a novel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof generation for automated theorem proving. By utilizing distinct specialized modelsâ€”a Reasoner for strategic subgoal lemmas and a Prover for verificationâ€”it liberates the model's full reasoning potential. From an Explainable AI (XAI) perspective, this modular design inherently enhances transparency. Separating the complex reasoning process into distinct, more manageable stages makes the AI's decision-making flow more interpretable. Users can better trace the logical steps taken by the AI, which is crucial for trust and understanding, especially in high-stakes domains like formal mathematics.
