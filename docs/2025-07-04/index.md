## AI Agents

### Ella: Embodied Social Agents with Lifelong Memory

**Relevance:** This paper introduces Ella, an embodied social agent capable of lifelong learning, memory, planning, and social interaction in a 3D open world. This directly aligns with the definition of AI agents as autonomous systems that perceive, reason, plan, and execute. The focus on accumulating experience, building social relationships, and evolving autonomously addresses key aspects of sophisticated AI agents, including adaptation and collaboration, which are central to human-agent interaction design.

### IR3D-Bench: Evaluating Vision-Language Model Scene Understanding as Agentic Inverse Rendering

**Relevance:** This paper proposes a benchmark, IR3D-Bench, that challenges Vision-Language Agents (VLAs) to demonstrate scene understanding through active creation and tool use (agentic inverse rendering). This directly speaks to the core of AI agent research: the ability to reason, plan actions, and execute them using available tools. The 'understanding-by-creating' approach offers a novel way to evaluate the generative and problem-solving capacities of VLAs, highlighting their potential as autonomous agents.

### A Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models: An Action Tokenization Perspective

**Relevance:** This survey unifies various Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by categorizing how they formulate 'action tokens'â€”the executable information leading to actions. This is fundamental to understanding how AI agents, especially those integrating vision and language, translate their reasoning and planning into real-world (or simulated) actions. By distilling the strengths and limitations of different action token types, the survey guides future research in creating more effective and versatile AI agents, impacting their interactive capabilities.

## LLM Evaluation Methods

### Answer Matching Outperforms Multiple Choice for Language Model Evaluation

**Relevance:** This paper critically re-examines traditional multiple-choice benchmarks for LLM evaluation, exposing their limitations. It proposes 'answer matching' as a more viable and scalable alternative, validated with human grading data. This research directly impacts the field of LLM evaluation methods by advocating for approaches that better align with human judgment and free-form responses, which is crucial for assessing user satisfaction and the real-world usability and coherence of LLM outputs, as highlighted by HCI principles.
