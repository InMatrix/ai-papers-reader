## Generative AI applied to supporting software developers
### CodexGraph: Bridging Large Language Models and Code Repositories via Code Graph Databases
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes a system that integrates LLMs with graph database interfaces extracted from code repositories, allowing for more precise and context-aware code retrieval and navigation. This approach could significantly improve the capabilities of generative AI tools for software developers, especially in complex tasks requiring understanding of entire code bases.

## Prompt engineering techniques that improve AI system performance
### StructEval: Deepen and Broaden Large Language Model Assessment via Structured Evaluation
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents a novel evaluation framework called StructEval that goes beyond single-item assessments to provide a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of LLM capabilities. This framework could be valuable for prompt engineers by offering deeper insights into how LLMs handle different types of prompts and reasoning tasks.

## Human-in-the-loop machine learning for improved training or evaluation
### Self-Taught Evaluators
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents a method for training model-based evaluators without relying on human preference judgments, thus reducing the cost and effort associated with collecting labeled data. This approach could be highly beneficial for developing human-in-the-loop systems where human feedback is used to improve AI models, especially in situations where collecting large amounts of labeled data is challenging.

## Applications of Generative AI in user interface design and engineering
### Openstory++: A Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Instance-aware Open-domain Visual Storytelling
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces a dataset that combines instance-level annotations with both images and text, enabling the development of models that can generate images with consistent instances across multiple frames. This dataset could be valuable for exploring generative AI applications in UI design, particularly for creating dynamic and responsive interfaces.

## Techniques to explain AI systems behavior to users
### IPAdapter-Instruct: Resolving Ambiguity in Image-based Conditioning using Instruct Prompts
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents a technique that combines image-based conditioning with textual prompts to control the generative process of diffusion models, allowing users to specify different interpretations of the same conditioning image. This approach could enhance the explainability of AI systems by providing users with more control and understanding over the generative process.
