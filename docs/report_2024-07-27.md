## Prompt engineering techniques that improve AI system performance

### [PrimeGuard: Safe and Helpful LLMs through Tuning-Free Routing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16318)

**Relevance:** This paper introduces PrimeGuard, a method for improving the safety and helpfulness of large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning. It dynamically routes queries to different instances of the model with varying instructions, leveraging the model's instruction-following capabilities. This approach resembles prompt engineering, where the input is carefully crafted to elicit desired responses, but PrimeGuard applies this technique at inference time.
