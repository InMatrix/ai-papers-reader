## AI for Software Development

### AgileCoder: Dynamic Collaborative Agents for Software Development based on Agile Methodology

**Relevance:** This paper directly applies AI to complex software development by introducing a multi-agent system that mimics the Agile methodology workflow. Agents are assigned roles (Product Manager, Developer, Tester) and collaborate dynamically across sprints. This moves beyond simple code completion to address the entire software lifecycle, including planning, refactoring, and quality assurance. The use of a Dynamic Code Graph Generator enhances the agents' ability to understand the codebase, improving precision in code generation and modification, which is crucial for real-world software engineering tools.
