## Generative AI applied to supporting software developers
### CodeV: Empowering LLMs for Verilog Generation through Multi-Level Summarization
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper explores the limitations of current LLMs for generating code in hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog, which is crucial for supporting software developers working on embedded systems or hardware design. The authors propose CodeV, a novel approach that utilizes LLMs for summarizing existing Verilog code to generate natural language descriptions, which are then used to generate new code.

## Human-in-the-loop machine learning for improved training or evaluation
### Practical Unlearning for Large Language Models
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper proposes the O3 framework for practical unlearning in LLMs, a technique that addresses the challenge of removing undesired data from the model's training without compromising its performance on other tasks. The O3 framework incorporates a novel Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detector and an orthogonal low-rank adapter, allowing for continuous unlearning of data while ensuring utility preservation. This research presents a valuable contribution to human-in-the-loop machine learning, as it enables users to actively control the training data and mitigate potential biases or inaccuracies.
