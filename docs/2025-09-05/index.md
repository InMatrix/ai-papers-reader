## AI for Software Development

### SQL-of-Thought: Multi-agentic Text-to-SQL with Guided Error Correction

**Relevance:** This paper proposes a multi-agent framework, SQL-of-Thought, that decomposes natural language queries into SQL queries. This directly relates to AI for Software Development by providing advanced assistance for code generation, specifically for database interactions. The framework's ability to identify subproblems, generate query plans, and perform taxonomy-guided error correction significantly enhances the robustness and accuracy of AI-driven code synthesis, addressing a crucial real-world challenge in software engineering. Its focus on reasoning and guided correction goes beyond simple code completion, offering a more comprehensive development aid.

## AI Agents

### The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey

**Relevance:** This comprehensive survey formalizes Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL), shifting LLMs from passive generators to autonomous decision-making agents. It proposes a taxonomy around core agentic capabilities: planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception. By consolidating open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks, this paper is highly relevant for understanding the current state and future directions of AI Agents. It emphasizes RL as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities into robust, adaptive agentic behavior.

### Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning

**Relevance:** Robix introduces a unified vision-language model for robots that integrates reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction. This aligns perfectly with the concept of AI Agents, as it enables autonomous systems to perceive, plan, and execute actions in physical environments. Robix's capabilities, such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning, demonstrate advanced agentic behavior and human-agent collaboration, making it a highly relevant paper for designing and deploying intelligent agents.

## LLM Evaluation Methods

### Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs

**Relevance:** This paper critically re-evaluates prompt sensitivity in LLMs, arguing that much of it is an artifact of current heuristic evaluation methods (e.g., rigid answer matching) rather than an inherent model flaw. It proposes 'LLM-as-a-Judge' evaluations to reduce variance and improve correlation. This directly impacts LLM evaluation methods by challenging existing benchmarks, advocating for more robust assessment techniques, and emphasizing the need to account for semantic correctness beyond surface-level phrasing, thereby providing a more accurate understanding of model capabilities and limitations.

### ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding

**Relevance:** ELV-Halluc introduces the first benchmark specifically designed to identify and systematically investigate 'Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations' (SAH) in long video multimodal LLMs. This addresses a critical gap in LLM evaluation, as SAH represents a unique type of hallucination distinct from those in short videos. By curating adversarial data and exploring mitigation strategies (like positional encoding and DPO), the paper provides new methods for robustness testing and a deeper understanding of limitations in complex multimodal models, directly advancing LLM evaluation techniques.

### The Gold Medals in an Empty Room: Diagnosing Metalinguistic Reasoning in LLMs with Camlang

**Relevance:** This paper introduces Camlang, a novel constructed language, to rigorously diagnose metalinguistic reasoning in LLMs, contrasting genuine reasoning with pattern matching. By creating a task (Camlang-CSQA-v0) that requires applying explicit grammar rules and lexical mappings, it provides a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm. This directly enhances LLM evaluation methods by offering a systematic way to assess fundamental gaps between LLM and human linguistic competence, moving beyond existing benchmarks to provide nuanced insights into their reasoning capabilities and limitations.

## Reinforcement Learning

### Beyond Correctness: Harmonizing Process and Outcome Rewards through RL Training

**Relevance:** This paper addresses a significant challenge in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for mathematical reasoning: the trade-off between coarse-grained outcome rewards and fine-grained, but noisy, process rewards. It introduces PROF, a data curation method that harmonizes these rewards through consistency-driven sample selection. This directly contributes to policy optimization in RL by providing more stable and effective gradient guidance, leading to improved accuracy and quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which is crucial for advancing LLM capabilities through RL.
