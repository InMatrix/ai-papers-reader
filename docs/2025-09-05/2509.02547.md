title: Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs&#58; A New Frontier in AI
---



A new survey paper, "The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs: A Survey," published in September 2025, outlines a significant paradigm shift in how large language models (LLMs) are utilized. It moves beyond treating LLMs as mere passive text generators and instead frames them as autonomous, decision-making agents capable of complex, long-horizon interactions within dynamic environments. This emerging field, termed "Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL)," leverages reinforcement learning (RL) as the core mechanism to imbue LLMs with crucial agentic capabilities.

The paper highlights that traditional LLM-RL approaches focused on single-turn outputs, akin to a static output generator. However, Agentic RL treats LLMs as learnable policies within sequential decision-making loops. This means an LLM agent can now plan, utilize tools, maintain memory, reason, and even self-improve over extended periods, much like a sophisticated AI agent.

To illustrate this conceptual leap, consider a conventional LLM tasked with writing a summary of a complex document. It would process the document once and produce a summary. In contrast, an Agentic RL-powered LLM agent, when faced with the same task, might first analyze the document's structure, identify key sections, use a search tool to find related information to clarify ambiguous points, store important findings in its memory, and then iteratively refine its summary based on feedback or self-reflection. This dynamic, multi-step process is a hallmark of Agentic RL.

The survey proposes a two-pronged taxonomy to organize the field. One categorizes agents based on their core capabilities: planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception. The other taxonomy classifies agent applications across various task domains, including search and research, coding, mathematical reasoning, GUI navigation, and multi-agent systems.

For example, in the domain of "search and research," an agent might not just retrieve information but actively engage in deep research, synthesizing insights from multiple sources. In "coding," an agent could not only generate code snippets but also iteratively refine them, debug, and even manage entire software engineering projects. The survey underscores that RL is the crucial enabler for transforming these capabilities from static modules into adaptive, robust behaviors.

The paper also provides a valuable compendium of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks essential for training and evaluating these agentic LLMs. This includes curated datasets and simulated environments designed to test and advance the capabilities of these sophisticated AI agents.

As the field rapidly evolves, the survey identifies key challenges such as trustworthiness, scaling agent training, and creating more complex agent environments. The authors emphasize that Agentic RL represents a significant step towards developing more scalable and general-purpose AI agents, capable of tackling increasingly complex real-world problems.
