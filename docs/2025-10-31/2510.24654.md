title: AI Agents Learn to Diagnose by Simulating Real Clinical Scenarios
---



**New York, NY** - Researchers have developed a novel framework that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to act as diagnostic agents, learning to make medical diagnoses through simulated patient interactions in a virtual clinical environment. This approach, detailed in a recent study, moves beyond simply training LLMs on static medical texts, instead enabling them to dynamically manage complex, multi-turn diagnostic processes and adaptively select examinations.

The core of this innovation lies in **DiagGym**, a sophisticated "diagnostics world model" built using electronic health records (EHRs). DiagGym simulates a virtual clinical environment, capable of generating realistic examination outcomes based on a patient's evolving condition. This allows a trained diagnostic agent, **DiagAgent**, to "interact" with simulated patients, order tests, and observe the results in a safe, closed-loop system.

Unlike previous methods that often relied on instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, DiagAgent learns through trial and error. It uses reinforcement learning to make decisions, such as which examination to recommend next or when to commit to a final diagnosis. The agent is rewarded for accurate diagnoses, informative test selections, and efficient diagnostic processes, while being penalized for redundant steps.

To evaluate this new approach, the researchers created **DiagBench**, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 750 physician-validated cases. This benchmark includes not only final diagnoses but also detailed, physician-annotated "rubrics" that assess the quality of the diagnostic reasoning process at each step.

The results are impressive. DiagAgent significantly outperformed leading state-of-the-art LLMs, including models like DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-40, in both single-turn and end-to-end diagnostic tasks. In one scenario, DiagAgent achieved a 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and a 23.09% boost in examination recommendation quality compared to its closest competitors. Furthermore, a qualitative assessment using physician-written rubrics showed DiagAgent to be 7.1% better than the next-best model, highlighting its ability to manage the intricate, multi-step nature of clinical diagnosis.

This research suggests that training LLMs within interactive, simulated clinical environments is crucial for developing robust, dynamic diagnostic capabilities. This dynamic learning approach allows LLMs to go beyond merely mimicking existing knowledge and instead discover potentially novel and more effective diagnostic strategies, paving the way for more advanced clinical AI assistants.
