## Generative AI for Assisting Software Developers

### CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis

**Relevance:** This paper presents CodeARC, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to perform inductive program synthesis, or programming by example. This directly relates to assisting software developers, as program synthesis is a core task in software development.  The interactive environment allows agents to iteratively refine their solutions, which mimics real-world coding scenarios. The evaluation of various models provides insights into the current state of AI assistance in coding.

## AI Agents

### VerifiAgent: a Unified Verification Agent in Language Model Reasoning

**Relevance:** VerifiAgent focuses on improving the reliability of LLM responses by integrating meta-verification and tool-based adaptive verification. This aligns with the goal of creating more robust and trustworthy AI agents.  The agent's ability to select appropriate verification tools based on the reasoning type demonstrates a key aspect of autonomous agency: the ability to use available tools to solve problems.  The code release will allow further research into agent verification.
