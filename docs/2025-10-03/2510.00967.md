title: QUASAR&#58; A New Framework for Generating Quantum Circuits with Large Language
  Models
---



In the rapidly advancing field of quantum computing, the ability to design and optimize complex quantum circuits is paramount. These circuits are the foundation for powerful quantum algorithms, but their creation is notoriously challenging. A new framework, dubbed QUASAR, aims to automate this process by leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) augmented with a sophisticated reinforcement learning approach.

QUASAR, developed by researchers at Aalto University and other institutions, addresses two key hurdles in LLM-based quantum circuit generation: the difficulty of accurately handling the numerous numerical parameters in quantum gates and the LLMs' inherent lack of deep quantum domain-specific knowledge, which often leads to incorrect or suboptimal circuits.

**How QUASAR Works: A Blend of LLMs, Tools, and Reinforcement Learning**

At its core, QUASAR employs an LLM to generate quantum circuits written in OpenQASM 3.0, a low-level, vendor-independent language for quantum assembly. To imbue the LLM with the necessary quantum expertise, QUASAR introduces two main innovations:

1.  **Tool-Augmented Verification:** The LLM interacts with an external "Quantum Tool Server." This server can simulate quantum circuits and perform verification. This feedback loop allows the LLM to learn from its mistakes by observing the outcome of simulations and identifying syntax errors or semantic inaccuracies in its generated code.

2.  **Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Reward:** QUASAR utilizes a four-level reward system to guide the LLM's learning process. This system prioritizes:
    *   **Syntactic Correctness:** Does the generated OpenQASM code adhere to the language's grammar?
    *   **Distributional Alignment:** How closely does the generated circuit's output distribution match the expected distribution for a correct circuit? This is measured using Jensen-Shannon entropy.
    *   **Expectation Value:** For optimization problems, how well does the generated circuit's expectation value align with the optimal solution?
    *   **Optimization Progress:** How efficiently can the generated circuit be optimized to reach a good solution?

This hierarchical approach ensures that a circuit is first syntactically valid, then semantically meaningful, and finally useful for solving specific quantum optimization problems.

**Concrete Examples of QUASAR's Impact**

Imagine a task like finding the shortest route for a delivery truck visiting multiple cities (a problem that can be mapped to quantum computing). Traditionally, a quantum expert would meticulously craft a quantum circuit, a process involving precise adjustments to many parameters within the circuit's gates. QUASAR aims to automate this by having the LLM propose a circuit.

If the LLM initially proposes a circuit with syntax errors, the Quantum Tool Server will flag it, and the LLM will be penalized. If the circuit is syntactically correct but doesn't perform well on the optimization task (e.g., it finds a very long route), the reward function will reflect this poor performance, guiding the LLM to adjust its parameters and structure. For instance, if the LLM generates a circuit for a Hamiltonian Path problem (as illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper), QUASAR's system would evaluate the quality of the proposed circuit. A good circuit would not only compile correctly but also yield near-optimal parameters for solving the specific pathfinding problem, similar to option (d) in Figure 1.

**Outperforming Existing Methods**

The researchers evaluated QUASAR by augmenting a 4-billion parameter LLM. The results showed significant improvements over leading industrial LLMs like GPT-40 and GPT-5, as well as other baseline methods. QUASAR achieved a remarkable 99.31% success rate in generating valid circuits on the first attempt (Pass@1) and 100% when considering the best of ten attempts (Pass@10). This demonstrates QUASAR's effectiveness in generating both syntactically correct and semantically meaningful quantum circuits, a crucial step towards wider adoption of automated quantum algorithm design.
