title: Quantizing Large Language Models for Code Generation&#58; A Differentiated
  Replication
---



Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing code generation, but their massive size presents significant challenges in deployment due to high memory demands. A new study, "Quantizing Large Language Models for Code Generation: A Differentiated Replication," published in arXiv, explores pushing the boundaries of model compression through quantization, achieving significant memory footprint reductions without substantial performance degradation.


**The Challenge of LLM Size**

The effectiveness of LLMs in generating code generally correlates with their size; more parameters mean better performance.  However, deploying large LLMs (e.g., 34 billion parameters) is computationally expensive and environmentally unfriendly due to their massive memory footprint.  Existing techniques to address this include using APIs for closed-source models or deploying the model on servers – neither of which is ideal due to data privacy concerns or costs.

**Quantization: A Solution**

The research replicates and extends prior work by Wei et al. (2023a) which explored using quantization to compress LLMs.  Quantization approximates high-precision numerical values (like floating-point numbers) with lower-precision representations (like integers).  The study employs the state-of-the-art Additive Quantization with Learned Multi-Codebooks (AQLM) technique.  AQLM employs a clever approach called Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ), which allows for extreme levels of compression, such as 2 bits per parameter. This is significantly more compression than previous studies.

**The Experiment**

The researchers tested AQLM on two prominent open-source LLMs specializing in code generation: CodeLlama and DeepSeek Coder.  They evaluated various sizes of these models (from 1.3 billion to 34 billion parameters), quantizing them to 8, 4, 3, and 2 bits per parameter. The experiments were conducted on two established code generation benchmarks, MultiPL-E and McEval, assessing the models' ability to correctly generate code in both Java and Python. To guide the quantization process, different calibration datasets were also used—random samples, a mix of code and natural language, and a code-specific dataset.


**Key Findings**

* **4-bit quantization is a sweet spot:**  The study found that 4-bit quantization, using AQLM, consistently achieved a 70% reduction in memory footprint compared to the original models without significant loss of accuracy in code generation.

* **Extreme quantization (3 and 2 bits) requires careful calibration:**  More extreme compression levels (3 and 2 bits) resulted in performance degradation, but this loss was mitigated by using a code-specific calibration dataset.  This dataset better guided the quantization process, helping to maintain accuracy.

* **Larger models are more resilient:**  Larger models (34 billion parameters) showed greater resilience to the effects of extreme quantization.  For example, the 2-bit quantized version of the 34B parameter model sometimes outperformed the full-precision (float16) version of the smaller 7B parameter model.  This suggests that extreme quantization might become feasible for even larger future models.

* **End-to-end fine-tuning can improve 2-bit performance:** Fine-tuning the quantized models (especially the 2-bit versions) further improved accuracy, potentially making even these extreme levels of compression practical.

**Implications**

The research demonstrates a viable path towards deploying large, powerful LLMs for code generation on resource-constrained devices.  This opens the door to environmentally friendly AI development, increased accessibility of advanced tools, and improved data privacy. The findings highlight the importance of calibration dataset selection, particularly for extreme quantization levels. Future work will focus on exploring even larger models and applying these techniques to broader code-related tasks.
