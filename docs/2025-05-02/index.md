## AI Agents

### WebThinker: Empowering Large Reasoning Models with Deep Research Capability

**Relevance:** This paper presents WebThinker, a deep research agent that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to autonomously search the web, navigate web pages, and draft research reports. This embodies the core characteristics of AI agents: perceiving the environment (the web), reasoning, planning actions (searching, navigating), and executing them.  Its focus on knowledge-intensive tasks and report generation aligns with the agent's goal of accomplishing user-defined goals through tool use.

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Chain-of-Defensive-Thought: Structured Reasoning Elicits Robustness in Large Language Models against Reference Corruption

**Relevance:** This paper introduces 'chain-of-defensive-thought' prompting, a technique to improve the robustness of LLMs against reference corruption by providing structured and defensive reasoning demonstrations. This falls directly under prompt engineering, exploring how carefully crafted prompts can elicit better and more robust responses from LLMs. The technique leverages the reasoning abilities of LLMs, which are enhanced by chain-of-thought prompting, to defend against prompt injection attacks.

## Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning

### Learning Explainable Dense Reward Shapes via Bayesian Optimization

**Relevance:** This paper addresses the problem of token-level credit assignment in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). It shapes token-level rewards using explainability methods (SHAP, LIME) and optimizes reward-shaping parameters using Bayesian Optimization. This is an example of incorporating human feedback into the machine learning process, making it an example of Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning.

### Toward Evaluative Thinking: Meta Policy Optimization with Evolving Reward Models

**Relevance:** This paper introduces Meta Policy Optimization (MPO), a framework that uses a meta-reward model to dynamically refine the reward model's prompt throughout training. This addresses issues with reward hacking and reliance on prompt engineering. The adaptive reward signal, refined based on the training context, reflects a form of human-in-the-loop learning where the reward system itself learns and adapts.

### SPC: Evolving Self-Play Critic via Adversarial Games for LLM Reasoning

**Relevance:** This paper proposes Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. Although it does not directly use human feedback, it automates the process of evaluating the quality of reasoning steps, which is typically a human task. The critic model can be seen as a proxy for human evaluation.

## Techniques for Explaining AI Behavior

### Softpick: No Attention Sink, No Massive Activations with Rectified Softmax

**Relevance:** This paper introduces softpick, a replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms. The key element relevant to XAI is that softpick produces sparse attention maps and hidden states with lower kurtosis. Sparsity in attention maps directly improves interpretability, making it easier to understand which parts of the input are most relevant for a given prediction. Lower kurtosis suggests a more even distribution of activation, potentially making the model's behavior more predictable and understandable.
