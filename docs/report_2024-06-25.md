**How are users involved in the evaluation of AI systems?**

- *Relevant Paper*: Arena-Hard and BenchBuilder Pipeline
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents BenchBuilder, a pipeline for creating high-quality benchmarks from crowd-sourced data. BenchBuilder utilizes an LLM annotator to select high-quality prompts from various topic clusters and an LLM judge to ensure the accuracy of the benchmark. This process allows for the integration of user feedback into the evaluation process of AI systems.

**What are the novel prompt engineering techniques that improve the performance of AI systems?**

- *Relevant Paper*: Whiteboard-of-Thought: Thinking Step-by-Step Across Modalities
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces whiteboard-of-thought prompting, a technique that encourages multimodal LLMs to generate intermediate reasoning steps as images, which are then used for further processing. This technique is shown to significantly improve the performance of LLMs on tasks that involve visual and spatial reasoning.

- *Relevant Paper*:  Self-play with Execution Feedback: Improving Instruction-following Capabilities of Large Language Models
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper introduces AutoIF, a technique for automatically generating instruction-following training data. AutoIF allows LLMs to generate instructions, code to check the correctness of the responses, and unit tests to verify the code's correctness. This approach generates high-quality data for training LLMs to follow instructions, improving their performance.

**What are the latest applications of generative AI in user interface design and engineering?**

- *Relevant Paper*: DigiRL: Training In-The-Wild Device-Control Agents with Autonomous Reinforcement Learning
    - *Why it's relevant*: This paper presents a novel approach for training in-the-wild device control agents using a pre-trained VLM. DigiRL fine-tunes a VLM in two stages: offline RL for initialization followed by offline-to-online RL. This approach enables the development of agents that can control real-world devices through GUIs, opening up new possibilities for generative AI in UI design and engineering.
