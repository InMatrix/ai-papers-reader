title: New Framework Reveals LLM Knowledge Interaction is Multidimensional, Not Binary
---



**Copenhagen, Denmark**—New research has overturned the traditional understanding of how Large Language Models (LLMs) combine internal memory with external evidence, showing that the process is far more complex than a simple binary choice.

A team from the University of Copenhagen introduced a novel framework using a “rank-2 projection subspace” to systematically disentangle the distinct contributions of Parametric Knowledge (PK)—the facts stored within the model’s weights—and Context Knowledge (CK)—the information provided in the prompt.

Previous methods attempting to analyze this interaction relied on a single-dimensional or "rank-1" approach, essentially treating the model's decision as a toggle: either rely on PK or rely on CK. The authors, Sekh Mainul Islam, Pepa Atanasova, and Isabelle Augenstein, found that this simplified view failed to capture rich interaction scenarios such as when PK and CK are **supportive** (reinforcing the same outcome) or **complementary** (providing different, useful pieces of information).

"We found that knowledge interaction is fundamentally multidimensional, not a binary competition," the researchers state.

### Dissecting the Explanation Process

The rank-2 framework allows scientists to track the exact balance between PK and CK contributions step-by-step as the LLM generates a Natural Language Explanation (NLE), or a justification for its answer.

Testing models like Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct across various Question Answering (QA) datasets revealed a dynamic interplay. For instances involving knowledge conflict (e.g., a query where the provided context contradicts a fact stored in the model’s memory, common in datasets like BaseFakepedia), the model initially draws on both sources but is forced to align more strongly with the CK direction toward the final answer token.

Conversely, in examples where the context and memory are supportive, the model retains a higher reliance on PK, using the external context merely as a regulator rather than the primary source.

### The Hallucination Alarm

Perhaps the most significant finding relates to factual reliability: the framework provides a mechanistic signal for detecting hallucination.

When the LLM generated NLEs containing hallucinated spans (i.e., unsupported or false information), the knowledge contributions consistently exhibited a strong, sustained alignment with the **PK direction**.

This strongly suggests that hallucinations are not just random generation errors but reflect a systematic bias toward "parametric recall" or internal memory when the model fails to ground its output accurately in the provided context. Faithful, contextually grounded NLEs, on the other hand, show a balanced use of both PK and CK axes.

The analysis also shed light on the efficacy of common techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. CoT was found to effectively encode itself as a distinct low-rank subspace that aligns more closely with the **CK direction**, clarifying why this reasoning methodology improves performance in tasks requiring strong contextual grounding.

By providing a precise, geometric method to track the causal flow of knowledge, this research offers a path toward controllably steering LLMs, enhancing both their interpretability and their factual consistency.
