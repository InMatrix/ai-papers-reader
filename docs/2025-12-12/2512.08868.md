title: EcomBench Pushes AI Agents to the Limit with Real-World E-commerce Scenarios
---



In a significant step toward assessing the practical readiness of autonomous AI agents, researchers from Tongyi Lab and Alibaba Group have unveiled EcomBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously test foundation models against the complex, dynamic challenges of the e-commerce domain.

While prior benchmarks for AI agents often focused on academic puzzles or artificially constrained environments, EcomBench shifts the focus to highly practical, decision-oriented tasks derived directly from global e-commerce ecosystems. The creators emphasize that success in e-commerce requires agents to integrate analytical reasoning, specialized domain expertise, and adaptive tool use—capabilities often lacking in generalized models.

EcomBench is built around four core principles, chief among them **Authenticity** and **Professionalism**. The dataset originates from genuine user demands collected from major e-commerce platforms and is refined and verified by experienced e-commerce experts, ensuring every query reflects a real-world operational issue.

The benchmark covers seven critical task categories common in daily e-commerce operations, ranging from **Policy Consulting** (e.g., navigating platform rules and tax registration) and **Fulfillment Execution** (logistics and returns) to high-stakes tasks like **Intelligent Product Selection** and **Marketing Strategy**.

### Gauging Difficulty with Concrete Challenges

To provide a comprehensive evaluation, the tasks are divided into three difficulty levels, reflecting the complexity of reasoning and tool usage required.

**Level 1** tasks are relatively straightforward, testing foundational e-commerce knowledge and basic tool operation. For example, a Level 1 Policy Consulting query might ask: "What is the maximum no-load power consumption allowed for a 48W laptop adapter under current U.S. energy regulations?" (Answer: 0.1 W).

However, the difficulty scales sharply. **Level 3** tasks—which constitute 50% of the benchmark—demand cross-source knowledge integration, deep information retrieval, and long-horizon planning.

A Level 3 **Cost and Pricing** question, for instance, challenges the agent to calculate the final price of a customized product bundle (electronics, books, and a digital course) sold to a consumer in Germany, requiring the model to simultaneously account for multiple variables: varying VAT rates, currency conversion, customs duties based on total goods value, and specific configuration fees applied only to the electronics. This type of multi-step, expert-level problem demonstrates the gap between simple retrieval and practical business decision-making.

### Current Agent Performance Reveals Limitations

Empirical evaluations of leading large language models (LLMs) and agents—including ChatGPT-5.1, Gemini DeepResearch, and SuperGrok Expert—show a clear drop-off in performance as complexity increases, validating the benchmark’s rigor.

While top-performing agents scored high in Level 1 tasks (typically 80% to 95% accuracy), their performance deteriorated significantly in Level 2 tasks, and dropped sharply in Level 3. Even the leading models saw their accuracy fall to 46% on the most challenging questions, with many remaining models scoring below 35%. This data confirms that while modern agents can reliably handle basic e-commerce tasks, they struggle immensely with complex requests involving extensive reasoning chains and adaptive tool usage.

The researchers intend for EcomBench to be a "living benchmark," maintained through a quarterly update cycle. This dynamism will ensure the tasks remain aligned with evolving market trends, policy changes, and emerging product categories, keeping the challenge relevant for the next generation of foundation agents.
