## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### Meta-Rewarding Language Models: Self-Improving Alignment with LLM-as-a-Meta-Judge

**Relevance:** This paper explores self-improving LLMs using a novel Meta-Rewarding technique where the model judges its own judgments and uses the feedback to refine its judgment skills. This approach has implications for prompt engineering as it highlights the importance of training models to understand and execute specific commands.
