title: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards&#58; Unlocking True Reasoning
  Potential
---



**New research suggests that Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) might be a more powerful tool for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning than previously thought, but its true effectiveness has been obscured by a flawed evaluation metric.**

For years, the field of artificial intelligence has been working to imbue LLMs with robust reasoning capabilities. A promising approach has been Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), where LLMs learn to generate "chains of thought" (CoTs) – step-by-step reasoning processes – and are rewarded based on the correctness of their final answers.

However, a perplexing observation has emerged: while RLVR-tuned models often show improvements in achieving correct answers on the first try (known as Pass@1), their performance on broader measures of success, like Pass@K (correct answers within the top K generated attempts), frequently fails to surpass their base models. This led to a hypothesis that RLVR simply re-weights existing reasoning paths, potentially sacrificing the diversity of reasoning strategies.

This new paper challenges that notion, proposing that the issue lies not with RLVR itself, but with how its success is being measured. The authors introduce a more rigorous evaluation metric called **CoT-Pass@K**, which requires *both* the reasoning chain (CoT) and the final answer to be correct.

**The Problem with Traditional Metrics: A Flawed Yardstick**

Imagine an LLM being asked to solve a complex math problem. The traditional Pass@K metric would credit it even if its step-by-step reasoning was riddled with errors, as long as it happened to stumble upon the correct final answer. This is akin to a student getting the right answer on a test through sheer luck or a flawed method, without truly understanding the underlying principles.

"Base LLMs often produce inaccurate or incomplete CoTs that coincidentally arrive at the correct solution due to their strong likelihood maximization capabilities," the paper explains. This means that while a model might get the right answer, its internal "thought process" might be fundamentally flawed.

**Introducing CoT-Pass@K: A More Honest Measure**

The new CoT-Pass@K metric aims to rectify this by demanding correctness at every stage. It acts as a much stricter judge, ensuring that the LLM not only arrives at the right destination but also follows a logical and accurate path to get there.

**RLVR's True Potential Revealed**

Using this refined metric, the researchers found that RLVR *does* indeed incentivize and improve correct reasoning across all values of K. This suggests that RLVR isn't just re-weighting existing paths; it's actively guiding LLMs towards generating more logically sound and complete reasoning processes.

The study also delves into the training dynamics, revealing that this improved reasoning ability emerges early in the training process and generalizes well to new problems. This offers a clearer understanding of RLVR's mechanisms and confirms its potential to genuinely advance machine reasoning capabilities.

"Our work provides a clear perspective on the role of RLVR, offers a more reliable method for its evaluation, and confirms its potential to genuinely advance machine reasoning," the authors conclude. This research could pave the way for more effective LLM training strategies, leading to AI systems that not only provide correct answers but also demonstrate a deep and reliable understanding of how to arrive at them.
