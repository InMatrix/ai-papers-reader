## Generative AI for Assisting Software Developers

### SWE-smith: Scaling Data for Software Engineering Agents

**Relevance:** This paper presents a pipeline, SWE-smith, for generating software engineering training data at scale by automatically synthesizing task instances that break existing tests in a codebase. This directly addresses the challenge of limited training data for software engineering agents. By creating a dataset of 50k instances from 128 GitHub repositories, it enables training better models (SWE-agent-LM-32B) for automated software engineering. This helps in code completion, bug detection and fixing, and refactoring.
