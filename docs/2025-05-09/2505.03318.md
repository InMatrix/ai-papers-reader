title: AI Model Achieves Human-Like Reasoning in Image and Video Analysis
---



**New AI model, UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK, integrates "chain-of-thought" reasoning to enhance accuracy and reliability in image and video understanding and generation reward tasks.**

In a significant stride towards artificial intelligence that mimics human cognitive processes, researchers have developed UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK, a new AI model capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step "chain-of-thought" (CoT) reasoning for visual understanding and generation. This model addresses a critical limitation in existing reward models (RMs), which often provide direct responses or engage in shallow reasoning, leading to inaccuracies.

The research paper, slated for publication next month, posits that incorporating explicit long CoTs into the reward reasoning process substantially strengthens reliability and robustness. Moreover, once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can be improved, even without explicit reasoning traces.

**How Does It Work?**

The team adopted an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize complex reasoning. The process unfolds in three distinct stages:

1.  **Cold Start:** To instill the structure and format of CoT reasoning, the model is initially trained using a small, high-quality dataset of image generation preferences distilled from GPT-4o.
    *   **Example:** The model learns to evaluate which of two generated images better matches a text caption.

2.  **Rejection Sampling:** Using its newfound reasoning capabilities, the model analyzes a large, diverse dataset of multimodal preferences, spanning various visual tasks. Correct reasoning trajectories are retained, reinforcing the distribution of accurate reasoning patterns.
    *   **Example:** The model assesses video temporal consistency and vision-question-answer accuracy.

3.  **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO):** Incorrectly reasoned samples are then used for GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore alternative reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions.

    *   **Example:** Given a set of images, the model learns to choose the image that has objects with relations in a text, improving the understanding of images.

**Concrete Benefits and Intuition**

The model's ability to explicitly reason is crucial. For instance, when evaluating if an image correctly depicts a described scene, UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK not only assigns a score but also explains its reasoning step-by-step: it analyzes semantic consistency (how well image content fits the caption), aesthetics, and authenticity.

Incorporating explicit CoT reasoning has a significant impact on the reward signal accuracy, the paper claims. Interestingly, after mastering CoT reasoning, the model exhibits implicit reasoning capabilities, which help surpass existing baselines, even without generating explicit reasoning chains.

The researchers conducted extensive experiments involving tasks like image/video generation and video understanding. Quantitative results showed a better performance when using the new model. Specifically, compared to the base model, UnifiedReward, the incorporation of multi-dimensional reasoning yields substantial performance gains across all tasks, reaching significant improvements in image understanding.

**Future Implications**

The research suggests that unlocking and enhancing reasoning in AI models could lead to more trustworthy and human-aligned outcomes in multimodal generation and understanding. Future work involves optimizing efficiency and exploring more efficient CoT formats.
