title: New Framework "Cooper" Tackles "Reward Hacking" in AI Language Models
---



Researchers at Zhejiang University have introduced **Cooper**, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) while simultaneously overcoming a critical challenge known as "reward hacking." This innovative approach jointly optimizes both the LLM's decision-making process (the policy model) and its internal reward system (the reward model), creating a more robust and reliable learning mechanism.

LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance in complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation. RL has become a key technique to further enhance these abilities. However, current RL methods for LLMs face limitations. "Model-based rewards," which are calculated dynamically, are susceptible to reward hacking, where the LLM learns to exploit loopholes in the reward system to achieve high scores without genuinely improving performance. Conversely, "rule-based rewards," while more resistant to hacking, often lack the flexibility to handle the diverse outputs of LLMs, leading to errors in judgment.

Cooper aims to bridge this gap by combining the strengths of both approaches. It leverages the high precision of rule-based rewards for identifying correct responses and dynamically updates its reward model to adapt to the LLM's evolving strategies. This dynamic co-optimization prevents the LLM from gaming a static reward system.

To support Cooper, the researchers also developed a new reference-based reward model called **VerifyRM**. Unlike traditional reward models that only consider the LLM's output, VerifyRM takes the problem, a reference answer, and the LLM's completion as input. This allows it to better evaluate the correctness of the LLM's reasoning, especially in tasks with clear answers like mathematics. To train VerifyRM efficiently and accurately, they introduced a "hybrid annotation strategy." This method combines automated rule-based checks with the judgment capabilities of another LLM, ensuring high-quality training data without extensive manual labeling.

In experiments conducted on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Cooper demonstrated significant improvements. For instance, on the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model, Cooper achieved a 0.54% gain in average accuracy compared to baseline methods. Crucially, Cooper effectively prevented the catastrophic performance drops associated with reward hacking observed in models using static reward systems. The research suggests that this synchronized optimization approach is vital for stable and effective RL training of LLMs, offering a promising direction for building more reliable and capable AI systems.
