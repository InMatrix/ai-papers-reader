title: M3-Agent&#58; The AI That Sees, Hears, Remembers, and Reasons
---



In a significant leap towards more human-like artificial intelligence, researchers have introduced M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent capable of processing real-time visual and auditory information to build and update a long-term memory. Unlike previous systems that might only store episodic memories of events, M3-Agent also develops semantic memory, allowing it to accumulate world knowledge over time. This allows for a deeper and more consistent understanding of its environment.

The core innovation of M3-Agent lies in its ability to process continuous streams of information and organize this data in an "entity-centric, multimodal format." This means that information about a specific person, for example, is all linked together, encompassing their face, voice, and any learned attributes or knowledge associated with them. This structured memory allows the agent to reason and perform tasks more effectively.

When given an instruction, M3-Agent doesn't just follow a rigid set of commands. Instead, it engages in multi-turn, iterative reasoning, retrieving relevant information from its long-term memory to accomplish the task. This is a crucial step towards AI agents that can truly understand and interact with the world in a nuanced way.

To evaluate the effectiveness of such memory-based reasoning, the researchers also developed M3-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed for long-video question answering. M3-Bench consists of two datasets: M3-Bench-robot, featuring 100 newly recorded real-world videos from a robot's perspective, and M3-Bench-web, comprising 929 videos sourced from the web across diverse scenarios. The benchmark includes question-answer pairs that test key capabilities such as human understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning.

The results are compelling: M3-Agent, trained using reinforcement learning, consistently outperformed the strongest baseline agents, including those powered by advanced models like Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-40. M3-Agent achieved a significant accuracy improvement across the M3-Bench datasets and another benchmark, VideoMME-long.

The research highlights the importance of both episodic and semantic memory for these agents. Ablation studies showed that removing semantic memory, which provides general world knowledge, significantly degraded performance. Furthermore, the study demonstrated the crucial role of reinforcement learning, inter-turn instructions, and the reasoning mode in achieving the agent's high performance.

In essence, M3-Agent represents a significant advancement in creating AI agents that can learn, remember, and reason about the world in a manner closer to human cognition, paving the way for more intelligent and capable AI systems in the future.
