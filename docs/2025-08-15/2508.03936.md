title: ASTRA&#58; New System Enhances AI Safety by Proactively Finding and Fixing
  Vulnerabilities
---



**Researchers have developed ASTRA, an automated system designed to discover and address safety flaws in AI assistants that generate code and provide security advice.** These AI tools, like GitHub Copilot, are increasingly integrated into software development, but their safety, especially in cybersecurity, remains a significant concern. Existing methods for testing AI safety often rely on pre-defined tests or unrealistic scenarios, missing many real-world vulnerabilities.

ASTRA tackles this by employing a three-stage approach. First, it builds detailed knowledge graphs that map out complex software tasks and common weaknesses. Imagine creating a comprehensive map of potential security pitfalls in, say, building a web application, including everything from common coding errors to specific library vulnerabilities.

Next, ASTRA performs "spatial and temporal exploration" to find vulnerabilities. *Spatial exploration* focuses on the AI's input space, probing it with realistic requests that developers might actually make. For example, instead of asking an AI to "write a poem about cybersecurity," ASTRA might ask it to "generate Python code to handle user uploads, ensuring no malicious files can be executed." This is like testing different ways a user might interact with the AI, looking for prompts that could lead to insecure outcomes.

*Temporal exploration*, on the other hand, delves into the AI's reasoning process. When an AI correctly declines a dangerous request, ASTRA analyzes *why* it declined. If the AI's reasoning is flawed or incomplete—for instance, it refuses a request based on a misunderstanding of a specific security principle—ASTRA identifies this weakness. It then crafts modified prompts that exploit these reasoning gaps. Think of it as finding out *how* an AI reaches its conclusions and then trying to trick it into making a mistake by subtly altering the information it's given.

Finally, ASTRA uses the identified vulnerabilities to improve the AI's safety through fine-tuning. This process aims to make the AI more robust without sacrificing its usefulness.

In their evaluation, ASTRA proved significantly more effective than existing techniques. Across two key domains—secure code generation and software security guidance—ASTRA uncovered 11% to 66% more issues. Furthermore, the test cases generated by ASTRA led to 17% more effective safety training for the AI models, demonstrating its practical value in creating more secure and reliable AI software assistants. This research is crucial for building trust in AI systems, especially as they become more integral to critical aspects of technology development.
