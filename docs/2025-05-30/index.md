### Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback

**Relevance:** This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning paradigm (Text2Grad) which is designed to take human feedback in the form of natural language and turn it into span-level gradient updates, more precisely adjusting the model's policy. It directly applies to the area of generative AI assisting software developers because the code generation task is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm. Such specific feedback can be used to, for example, help an AI assistant generate code that is correct and satisfies the developer's needs.

## AI Agents

### Reinforcing Multi-Turn Reasoning in LLM Agents via Turn-Level Credit Assignment

**Relevance:** This paper investigates enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents using reinforcement learning in multi-turn tool-use scenarios, directly relevant to AI agent research. The focus on turn-level credit assignment addresses the challenge of training agents for complex decision-making, where the agent needs to break down complex tasks, use reasoning, and interact with digital tools. This work contributes directly to improving AI agents' ability to accomplish user-defined goals through better planning and execution.

## Human-in-the-loop Machine Learning

### Text2Grad: Reinforcement Learning from Natural Language Feedback

**Relevance:** This paper aligns with human-in-the-loop ML because it presents a new reinforcement-learning paradigm that turns free-form textual feedback into span-level gradients. It exemplifies using human preferences to directly refine the portions of the model's policy that generate code, summaries, or answers. Thus, natural-language feedback becomes a signal for fine-grained policy optimization.

## Techniques for Explaining AI Behavior

### Unveiling Instruction-Specific Neurons & Experts: An Analytical Framework for LLM's Instruction-Following Capabilities

**Relevance:** This paper introduces SPARCOM, an analytical framework, to explore the relationship between fine-tuning-induced adaptations and sparse computational substrates in LLMs. It falls under Explainable AI (XAI) as it examines how fine-tuning reconfigures LLM computations by isolating and analyzing instruction-specific sparse components (neurons and experts). The work provides deeper insights into how LLMs internalize instruction-following behavior, helping make the models' decision-making processes more transparent.

### Meta-Learning an In-Context Transformer Model of Human Higher Visual Cortex

**Relevance:** This paper relates to XAI because it demonstrates that BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretability of neural signals in higher visual cortex by attending to semantically relevant stimuli. By jointly conditioning on image features and voxel activations, the models learn to directly generate better performing voxelwise models of higher visual cortex. Further, BraInCoRL facilitates better interpretable mappings from natural language queries to voxel selectivity. These methods and analysis techniques can be used to help visualize which part of the input is important and understand how a model attends to them.
