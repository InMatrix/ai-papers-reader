## Prompt engineering techniques that improve AI system performance
### Chain-of-Knowledge: Integrating Knowledge Reasoning into Large Language Models by Learning from Knowledge Graphs
ðŸ’¡ *Why it's relevant*: This paper focuses on improving reasoning abilities in LLMs by integrating knowledge from knowledge graphs. The proposed "Chain-of-Knowledge" framework addresses the problem of rule overfitting by introducing a trial-and-error mechanism, mimicking human reasoning. This method has implications for prompt engineering as it enhances the LLM's ability to understand and utilize external knowledge, making it more effective in complex reasoning tasks.
