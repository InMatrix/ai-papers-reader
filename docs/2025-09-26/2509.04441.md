title: Scientists Unveil DEXOP&#58; A New Paradigm for Teaching Robots Dexterous Human
  Skills
---



Researchers have introduced a novel hardware system called DEXOP (A Device for Robotic Transfer of Dexterous Human Manipulation), pioneering a data collection paradigm dubbed "perioperation." This breakthrough addresses the critical bottleneck in robotics: acquiring high-quality, large-scale data that captures the fine-grained touch and force required for human-level dexterity.

For years, training robots for complex manipulation has relied on simulation, human videos, or teleoperation. However, these methods often fail to capture rich, multi-sensory data—specifically force, proprioception, and touch—that is essential for teaching robust skills like unscrewing a tight bottle cap or precisely assembling components.

DEXOP overcomes this by combining a wearable passive exoskeleton with a passive robotic hand via a mechanical linkage system. Unlike traditional teleoperation, where a human remotely controls a robot via a joystick or visual feedback, perioperation involves the human directly wearing and moving the device. The motion of the human fingers drives the passive robot hand, which is instrumented with high-resolution, whole-hand tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm.

### Superior Feedback for Faster Training

The key innovation lies in the system's "force transparency." Because the human hand is mechanically coupled to the robotic hand, the user experiences direct proprioceptive feedback and the forces encountered by the robot hand. This makes task demonstration far more natural and accurate.

To test its efficiency, the team conducted user studies comparing DEXOP to standard visual-based teleoperation across various manipulation tasks, including drilling, box packaging, and bulb installation. The results were dramatic: DEXOP achieved significantly higher data collection throughput.

For a complex, multi-step task like *bulb installation* (screwing a light bulb into a base), participants using DEXOP were eight times faster than those using teleoperation. This efficiency stems directly from the improved sensory feedback.

In teleoperation, operators struggled to determine when the bulb was fully tightened, often leading to over-rotation and dataset bias. With DEXOP, the human operator uses the real-time shear force data captured by the tactile sensors to precisely judge the moment the bulb is secured, just as they would with their bare hand.

### Unlocking Fine-Grained Dexterity

DEXOP is designed to capture two types of advanced manipulation skills: precise finger manipulation and whole-hand coordination.

For *precise finger manipulation*, the system enables actions like reorienting a puck or picking up and fastening a tiny M2 screw and cap—tasks demanding fingertip precision and pose adjustments often impossible with simpler grippers.

For *whole-hand manipulation*, DEXOP captures complex coordination, such as opening a seasoning bottle where the thumb unscrews the lid while the index, middle, and ring fingers stabilize the bottle against the palm. Specialized hardware enhancements, including integrated fingernails and movable abduction joints between the fingers, further expand the range of tasks DEXOP can demonstrate.

The team developed several variants of the system, including the advanced DEXOP-12 (with four fingers and 12 degrees of freedom) and DEXOP-7, which was co-designed to match the kinematics of a real robotic system (the EyeSight Hand) used for policy deployment.

By making it vastly easier to capture accurate, contact-rich data at scale, DEXOP and the perioperation approach offer a powerful new tool for developing robust, real-world robotic policies and accelerating the co-evolution of advanced robotic hardware and learning algorithms.
