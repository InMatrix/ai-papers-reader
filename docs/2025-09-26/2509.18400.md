title: New AI Model ATLAS Promises to End Trade Delays by Solving Customs Code Bottleneck
---



A specialized Large Language Model (LLM) named ATLAS has achieved state-of-the-art performance in classifying products under the complex Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), a critical process bottleneck in global commerce. The model, detailed in a new research paper, not only significantly surpasses leading proprietary AI systems like GPT-5-Thinking and Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking in accuracy but is also up to eight times cheaper to operate, offering a pathway to dramatically reduce international shipping friction and delays.

The 10-digit HTS code is mandatory for every product crossing international borders. Misclassification—which can stem from the system spanning over 17,000 pages of legal documents—is a perennial problem that can halt entire shipments. Recent incidents, including major postal operators suspending U.S. deliveries due to incomplete customs paperwork, underscore the fragility of trade flows when accurate classification is not automated at scale.

Researchers introduced the ATLAS benchmark, the first open-source dataset for HTS classification derived from authoritative U.S. Customs Rulings (CROSS). They then fine-tuned the LLaMA-3.3-70B model to create ATLAS, a specialized solution for this high-stakes domain.

### Achieving Customs-Ready Accuracy

The HTS system is hierarchical. The first six digits are globally harmonized, defining broad product categories, while the last four are country-specific extensions required for full customs clearance.

For instance, consider a product like a high-end **semiconductor wafer**. Achieving the correct global six-digit code (e.g., 8542.31) ensures international agreement on the product type. However, U.S. customs requires all ten digits (e.g., 8542.31.0000) to clear the shipment.

On the difficult 10-digit U.S.-specific classification, ATLAS achieved 40% fully correct classifications—meaning nearly half of all test products were immediately customs-ready. In comparison, the general-purpose GPT-5-Thinking only achieved 25% accuracy, and Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking hit 13.5%.

When evaluated on the 6-digit globally harmonized code (Partially Correct Classification), ATLAS also demonstrated superior reasoning, achieving 57.5% accuracy, slightly edging out GPT-5-Thinking’s 55.5%. This success indicates the model’s utility extends across global trade applications, not just U.S. compliance.

### Cost and Privacy Advantage

Beyond the performance gains, the economic advantages of ATLAS are substantial. The fine-tuned, open-source model supports self-hosted deployment, a crucial feature for high-stakes sectors like automotives and semiconductors that require maximum data privacy.

The paper reports that inference using ATLAS is nearly five times cheaper than using proprietary APIs like GPT-5-Thinking (costing an estimated \$0.70 per 1,000 inferences compared to ~\$3.30 for GPT-5). This cost efficiency makes it practical for scaling classification across thousands of products daily.

Despite ATLAS setting a strong baseline, the authors emphasize that HTS classification remains an open challenge. The 40% 10-digit accuracy figure highlights significant room for improvement, particularly through future research focusing on integrating retrieval-augmented methods—allowing the LLM to search the vast HTS documentation—and advanced reasoning techniques. Researchers have released both the ATLAS model and the underlying dataset to encourage global AI community engagement in solving this critical trade problem.
