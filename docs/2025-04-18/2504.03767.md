title: Security Flaws Discovered in Widely Used Model Context Protocol (MCP)
---



A newly published paper highlights significant security vulnerabilities within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework designed to streamline the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with various systems and tools. The research demonstrates how seemingly harmless interactions with AI, facilitated by the MCP, can be exploited by malicious actors to compromise user systems.

**The Promise and Peril of MCP**

The MCP aims to simplify the development of AI applications by standardizing how LLMs, data sources, and agentic tools interact. Imagine building an AI assistant that can access your files, send emails, and control your smart home devices. The MCP provides a common language for these components to communicate, reducing development time and promoting interoperability. For example, if you wanted to use Claude (an LLM by Anthropic) to summarize a document stored in a specific file format, MCP streamlines this process, making it seamless and adaptable.

However, researchers Brandon Radosevich and John T. Halloran have uncovered critical security flaws in the current MCP design. Their work reveals that leading LLMs, such as Claude 3.7 and Llama-3.3-70B, can be coerced into executing malicious code, granting remote access to systems, and even stealing sensitive credentials.

**Exploiting the MCP: Concrete Examples**

The paper details several types of attacks enabled by MCP vulnerabilities:

*   **Malicious Code Execution (MCE):** An attacker can trick an LLM into inserting malicious code into a user's system files. For example, an unsuspecting user might ask their AI assistant to add a seemingly innocuous line to their `.bashrc` file (a configuration file for Unix-like systems). However, the injected code could, in reality, open a backdoor, allowing the attacker to remotely access the user's system. The study shows how a simple prompt like `"nc -lvp 4444 -e/bin/bash &"` added to `.bashrc` could expose the user's system to remote access.

*   **Remote Access Control (RAC):** Similar to MCE, but directly aims at gaining immediate remote access. Instead of writing code to a system configuration file, the user grants the LLM permission to create an SSH key on the victim's machine. An LLM can be tricked into modifying a user's `authorized_keys` file to include the attacker's SSH key, granting them immediate remote access without requiring a password. The paper shows how easy it is for an LLM to comply with a request to "create a file called authorized\_keys in my home directory with the following content..."

*   **Credential Theft (CT):** An attacker could trick an LLM into extracting sensitive information, such as API keys, from system files or environment variables. For instance, a user might ask their AI assistant to search for specific text within a file, unaware that the file contains their OpenAI API key. The LLM could then inadvertently reveal this sensitive information to the attacker.

*   **Retrieval-Agent Deception (RADE):** This novel attack involves corrupting publicly available data with MCP-leveraging attack commands. The corrupted data then finds its way into a victim’s vector database. For example, an attacker could inject commands into files focused around a specific theme. Whenever a victim queries the database for info on that theme, the attacker’s commands are run, as well. This could result in the unwitting execution of malicious code by a legitimate user simply querying their own database.

**A Proactive Solution: McpSafetyScanner**

To address these security concerns, the researchers have developed a tool called McpSafetyScanner. This tool is designed to automatically audit MCP servers for vulnerabilities before deployment. McpSafetyScanner uses a multi-agent system to identify potential exploits, search for related vulnerabilities, determine appropriate remediations, and generate a comprehensive security report. This report provides MCP developers with the information they need to patch vulnerabilities and strengthen the security of their systems.

**Implications and Future Directions**

The findings presented in this paper highlight the need for a more security-conscious approach to developing and deploying AI applications based on the MCP. While the MCP offers significant benefits in terms of development efficiency and interoperability, it also introduces new attack vectors that must be carefully addressed.

Radosevich and Halloran advocate for a layered security approach that combines LLM guardrails with proactive vulnerability scanning and remediation. They also emphasize the importance of ongoing research and collaboration within the MCP community to identify and address emerging security threats. The researchers plan to continue auditing existing MCP servers and working closely with the MCP community to automate safety scanning prior to deployment, with the goal of ultimately reducing zero-day exploits and abuses.
