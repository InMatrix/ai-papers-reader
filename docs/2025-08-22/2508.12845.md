title: New Benchmark CAMAR Promises Faster, More Realistic Multi-Agent Robot Navigation
  Training
---



Researchers have introduced CAMAR (Continuous Actions Multi-Agent Routing), a new benchmark designed to accelerate the development of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems for complex robotic navigation tasks. The benchmark aims to bridge the gap between current MARL environments and the demands of real-world robotics by offering a fast, scalable, and realistic simulation platform.

Current MARL benchmarks often simplify navigation into grid worlds with discrete actions, failing to capture the smooth motion and collision avoidance crucial for robotic systems. While some environments offer continuous actions, they struggle with scalability to large numbers of agents or are too slow for efficient training. CAMAR addresses these limitations by providing a highly performant environment that supports continuous states and actions, allowing for hundreds or even thousands of agents to navigate complex, continuous spaces.

One of CAMAR's key features is its speed. Leveraging JAX and GPU acceleration, the benchmark can achieve over 100,000 environment steps per second. This rapid simulation capability is vital for training sophisticated MARL agents, enabling researchers to run extensive experiments and iterate on algorithms more quickly. For instance, CAMAR can handle scenarios with 32 agents moving through a cluttered environment at roughly 50,000 steps per second, a rate significantly higher than existing benchmarks like VMAS, which drops to around 500 steps per second with the same number of agents.

CAMAR also introduces a three-tier evaluation protocol to standardize performance assessment and encourage generalization. These tiers—Easy, Medium, and Hard—test agents on their ability to solve tasks across different map types, agent counts, and obstacle configurations, moving beyond simple memorization of fixed scenarios. This rigorous evaluation framework is crucial for ensuring reproducible and comparable results across different MARL methods.

To further support the MARL community, CAMAR allows the integration of classical path planning methods like RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) and RRT* directly into MARL pipelines. These methods can be used as baselines or combined with learning algorithms to create hybrid approaches. The paper demonstrates that integrating RRT* with algorithms like MAPPO improves performance in terms of flowtime and makespan, suggesting that combining planning with learning can lead to more efficient navigation. For example, RRT*+MAPPO achieved a success rate of 0.828, a flowtime of 971, and a makespan of 150.4 on the random_grid map, outperforming MAPPO alone.

The benchmark also supports heterogeneous agents, meaning agents can have different sizes, speeds, or control dynamics. This feature is crucial for simulating real-world multi-robot systems where diversity is common. For example, CAMAR can simulate scenarios where some agents use holonomic dynamics (moving freely in any direction) while others use differential drive dynamics (like a car).

In summary, CAMAR offers a robust platform for advancing MARL research by providing a fast, scalable, and realistic environment for multi-agent navigation and coordination tasks. Its features aim to facilitate the development of more intelligent and adaptable robotic systems capable of operating effectively in complex, dynamic real-world scenarios. The code for CAMAR is publicly available, encouraging widespread adoption and further development within the research community.
