title: From AI for Science to Agentic Science&#58; A New Era of Autonomous Discovery
---



Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a tool for scientists; it's evolving into a sophisticated research partner. A new survey paper, "From AI for Science to Agentic Science: A Survey on Autonomous Scientific Discovery," positions "Agentic Science" as a pivotal stage where AI systems exhibit full scientific agency, moving beyond mere assistance to autonomous discovery.

This groundbreaking paper, authored by researchers from Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and other institutions, outlines a comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing this shift. Agentic AI, powered by advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal systems, can now independently formulate hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze results, and iteratively refine its findings. This represents a significant leap from AI as a mere "computational oracle" or "automated research assistant" to a true "autonomous scientific partner" and potentially even a "generative architect" capable of inventing new scientific methods.

The survey highlights five core capabilities that underpin this "agentic" behavior: reasoning and planning, tool integration, memory mechanisms, collaboration between agents, and optimization and evolution. These capabilities enable a dynamic four-stage scientific discovery workflow: observation and hypothesis generation, experimental planning and execution, data and result analysis, and synthesis, validation, and evolution.

To illustrate these concepts, the paper provides concrete examples across various scientific disciplines. For instance, in life sciences, an AI agent named **OriGene** functions as a virtual disease biologist, autonomously identifying and validating novel therapeutic targets for liver and colorectal cancer. Similarly, in chemistry, the **Coscientist** system, powered by GPT-4, demonstrated its ability to autonomously design, plan, and execute a complex chemical reaction in a physical lab, optimizing conditions for palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings. In materials science, **ChatMOF** utilizes an AI system to predict properties and generate new Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), leading to the experimental synthesis of novel materials.

The paper delves into the specific applications of agentic AI in life sciences, chemistry, materials science, and physics, showcasing how these systems are accelerating research in areas like drug discovery, protein engineering, molecular design, and even the simulation of complex physical phenomena.

However, the authors also acknowledge significant challenges. Ensuring reproducibility, validating the novelty of AI-generated hypotheses, and maintaining transparency in scientific reasoning are critical hurdles. Ethical considerations, such as accountability for erroneous findings and the potential impact on scientific labor and education, are also paramount.

Looking ahead, the survey envisions future directions for agentic science, including the potential for AI agents to engage in "autonomous invention" and interdisciplinary synthesis. The ultimate goal, they suggest, is a "global cooperation ecosystem of scientific agents" and the pioneering of a "Nobel-Turing Test" for AI scientists, where AI makes Nobel Prize-worthy discoveries.

In essence, this paper provides a crucial roadmap for the evolving landscape of scientific discovery, positioning agentic AI not as a replacement for human ingenuity, but as a powerful co-evolving partner that augments creativity and accelerates the pace of scientific progress.
