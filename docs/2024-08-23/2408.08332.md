Researchers from Adobe have developed a new method called TurboEdit for text-based image editing that leverages the power of few-step diffusion models. Unlike previous methods that rely on multi-step diffusion models and are often slow and computationally intensive, TurboEdit performs image edits in just a few steps, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Here's how TurboEdit works:

* **Real Image Inversion:** The method uses a single-step encoder-based inversion technique to efficiently project a real image into the noise space of the diffusion model. This is significantly faster than previous methods that rely on multi-step inversion, which often requires 50 or more steps.

* **Disentangled Text Prompt Conditioning:**  Instead of relying on attention-based methods that freeze attention maps to preserve structural similarity, TurboEdit exploits the property of few-step diffusion models, where long and detailed text prompts are inherently disentangled. This means that modifying a single attribute in the text prompt results in only minor changes to the text embedding, leading to disentangled edits in the image space.

* **Instruction-Based Editing:** Users can leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) to generate highly descriptive text prompts. By providing a short instruction to the LLM, like "change the dog to a cat," the LLM can generate a detailed text prompt that captures the desired edits. This makes it easier for users to create complex edits with just a few instructions.

**TurboEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both speed and quality. It achieves high-quality edits with minimal artifacts, requires only 8 steps for inversion (a one-time cost) and 4 steps per edit, and can perform continuous editing by interpolating between text prompts.**

Here are some examples of what TurboEdit can do:

* **Replace an object:** A user can replace a cat in an image with a dog by providing a simple instruction like "change the cat to a dog."
* **Add or remove attributes:** TurboEdit can add a hat to a person, change the color of their hair, or make an image look like a child's drawing.
* **Perform complex edits:**  Users can modify multiple attributes simultaneously, such as changing a person's shirt and hair color at the same time.
* **Apply edits to specific regions:**  TurboEdit supports local masking, which enables users to apply edits only to specific regions of the image.

**TurboEdit is a significant advancement in text-based image editing. It is faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly than previous methods, opening up new possibilities for creative image manipulation.**
