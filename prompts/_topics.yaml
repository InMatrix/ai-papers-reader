- topic: AI for Software Development
  description: |
    Generative AI is increasingly being used to assist software developers in various tasks. Some examples include:
    - Code completion and generation: Tools like GitHub Copilot use LLMs to suggest code snippets, complete functions, or even generate entire code blocks based on natural language descriptions.
    - Bug detection and fixing: AI systems can analyze code to identify potential bugs, suggest fixes, or even automatically repair simple issues.
    - Documentation generation: LLMs can help create or improve code documentation by generating summaries, explaining complex functions, or writing API documentation.
    - Code refactoring: AI can suggest ways to improve code structure, readability, and efficiency.

- topic: AI Agents
  description: |
    AI Agent research is the field studying autonomous software systems that can perceive their environment, reason about tasks, plan actions, and execute them using available tools and resources. These agents typically combine large language models (serving as their "brain") with capabilities like memory, tool use, and planning to accomplish user-defined goals. The field focuses on creating agents that can:
    - Break complex tasks into manageable steps
    - Use reasoning to make decisions and solve problems
    - Learn from experience and adapt strategies
    - Interact with digital tools and environments
    - Work independently or collaborate with other agents
    - Maintain safety and alignment with human values

- topic: LLM Evaluation Methods
  description: |
    Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for understanding their capabilities, limitations, and alignment with user needs. Key evaluation methods include:
    - Benchmarking: Using standardized datasets to assess performance across tasks like text generation, summarization, and question answering.
    - Human-in-the-loop evaluation: Involving human evaluators to rate outputs for relevance, coherence, and usability.
    - Robustness testing: Assessing model performance under adversarial inputs or edge cases.
    - Ethical and bias evaluation: Identifying and mitigating biases in model outputs to ensure fairness and inclusivity.
    From an HCI perspective, evaluation methods should also consider user satisfaction, trust, and the cognitive load required to interact with the model.

- topic: Reinforcement Learning
  description: |
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn optimal behaviors by interacting with environments and receiving rewards or penalties. Key aspects include:
    - Policy optimization: Techniques like Q-learning and actor-critic methods for improving decision-making strategies.
    - Exploration vs. exploitation: Balancing the need to explore new actions with leveraging known rewards.
    - Multi-agent RL: Studying interactions and cooperation between multiple agents in shared environments.
    - Novel agent environment design: Creating innovative and adaptive environments that challenge agents and facilitate learning of complex behaviors.
    From an HCI perspective, RL research explores how humans can effectively guide agent learning, interpret agent behaviors, and design environments that facilitate intuitive human-agent collaboration.

- topic: Explainable AI
  description: |
    Explainable AI (XAI) aims to make AI decision-making processes more transparent and interpretable. Some techniques include:
    - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): Providing local explanations for individual predictions by perturbing input features.
    - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Calculating feature importance based on game theory concepts.
    - Attention visualization: In models like transformers, visualizing attention weights to show which parts of the input the model focuses on.
    - Counterfactual explanations: Showing how changes in input would affect the output, helping users understand decision boundaries.
    - Rule extraction: Deriving human-readable rules from complex models to approximate their behavior.
